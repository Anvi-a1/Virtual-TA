Effective visuals connect analysis to decisions. This module spotlights the tools that help you design narratives, build interactive experiences, and adapt outputs for every kind of audience.

You’ll practice:

* **Story-first planning** with data storytelling frameworks and LLM partners such as ChatGPT to refine messaging.
* **Portable presentations** spanning HTML decks in RevealJS, Markdown slides in Marp, and notebook-native sessions in Marimo.
* **Specialized builders** including RAWgraphs, Seaborn, Excel forecasting charts, Flourish animations, PowerPoint motion, and Kumu network diagrams.
* **Collaborative perspectives** through actor network visualizations and AI-assisted storytelling that keep stakeholders aligned.

Use these resources to turn complex analyses into clear, compelling stories wherever your viewers meet them.
