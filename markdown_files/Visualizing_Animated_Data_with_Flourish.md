You’ll learn how to create and customize animations in Flourish, covering:

* **Core Animation Principles:** Understand how to use animation to both engage and inform, and learn the concept of “object constancy” to turn data visualizations into compelling data stories.
* **Configuring Race Charts:** Master the animation controls for Line Chart Races and Bar Chart Races, including setting durations for timelines, transitions, and individual stages.
* **Morphing Between Chart Types:** Learn to use the Line Bar Pie template to create seamless morphing transitions between different chart types (e.g., line to streamgraph) within a Flourish story.
* **Animating Scatter Plots:** Discover how to set up and control animations in scatter plots, including using the “Animation stagger” setting to create dynamic, cascading dot movements.
* **Controlling Animation Logic:** Understand how to manage animations for both related and unrelated datasets by toggling the “Only animate series with same name” option.
* **Animation in Other Templates:** Get an overview of the animation settings available in various other templates, including Survey, Heatmap, Spider, and Hierarchy charts.
* **Advanced Data Explorer Animations:** Learn about the powerful Data Explorer template (an Enterprise feature) and its ability to create advanced animations, such as morphing dots from a survey layout into their corresponding locations on a projection map.
