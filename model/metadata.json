AI Coding\" original_url: \"https://tds.s-anand.net/#/ai-coding?id=ai-coding\" downloaded_at: \"2025-11-17T01:53:53.232841\" AI Coding AI-assisted development pairs human judgment with generative models across every workspace. This module shows how to set up productive collaborations, feed models the right project context, and ship code you trust. You’ll explore: Creative prompting that shapes tone and flow through vibe coding sessions and scenario planning. Environment-specific tooling for working in browser editors, IDE extensions, and CLI companions without losing momentum. Context engineering practices that stage repositories, snippets, and docs so models stay grounded in your codebase. Quality safeguards that weave in automated tests, structured reviews, and targeted tool calls to keep AI-written code production ready. By the end you will know when to lean on AI, how to steer it with precise context, and the guardrails that turn generated snippets into maintainable features. Remember that AI coding is a fast-evolving field. Some techniques in this course are likely to become more important with time, like: Spec-first development — regulation, SLAs, and team audits rise; clear specs make agents repeatable and safe. Premortem tests — cheaper runs + judge limits mean runnable tests become the contract, not chat. Context engineering — longer, cheaper context rewards right-sized, high-signal inputs; models “pay attention” better. IDE-native agents — deeper codebase awareness + live previews beat copy-paste as default. Model Context Protocol (MCP) — real exploits + enterprise controls push standard, least-privilege tool access. Sandbox/approvals (least-privilege) — prompt-injection and governance make allowlists and approvals mandatory. Scorecard-driven eval loops — throughput gains enable multi-variant drafts; automatic selectors pick winners. Parallel agents (MoA) — faster inference + LLM-judges favor draft-and-select over one-shot tries. Property-based fuzzing — AI code fails at edges; cheap fuzzing finds them. Mutation testing — ensures tests bite; counters “almost-right” patches. LLM-assisted grading (advisory) — judges are useful signals; pair with runnable tests as costs drop. CLI-first agents & CI — on-device + auditability + low cost make batch/CI flows standard. Inline AI coding sandboxes — dynamic code + multimodal previews shrink idea→demo time. Sub-agents — bigger tasks and longer context benefit from scoped roles; less drift, safer edits. Some of the things covered in this course are likely to become less important , like: Copy-paste chat ↔ editor — still useful for learning, but IDE/CLI agents with context beat it daily. Monolithic all-access agents — replaced by least-privilege tools, approvals, and scoped servers. Judge-only approvals — LLM judges stay advisory; tests and gates make the final call. Stuff-everything prompts — long context helps, but right-sizing beats dumping; fetch extra only when needed. Hosted workbenches for pro teams — great for demos/edu; privacy and on-device tilt pros to IDE/CLI. Manual, unlogged prompt tinkering — replaced by versioned prompts, PR links, and logs for audit. One-thread-does-everything sessions — reset-over-repair and sub-agents are faster and cleaner. After-the-fact testing — premortem tests become the norm; they lock intent before agents code.

LLMs incur a cost. For the May 2025 batch, use aipipe.org as a proxy. Emails with @ds.study.iitm.ac.in get a $1 per calendar month allowance. (Don’t exceed that.) Read the AI Pipe documentation to learn how to use it. But in short: Replace OPENAI_BASE_URL , i.e. https://api.openai.com/v1 with https://aipipe.org/openrouter/v1... or https://aipipe.org/openai/v1... Replace OPENAI_API_KEY with the AIPIPE_TOKEN Replace model names, e.g. gpt-4.1-nano , with openai/gpt-4.1-nano For example, let’s use Gemini 2.0 Flash Lite via OpenRouter for chat completions and Text Embedding 3 Small via OpenAI for embeddings: ``` curl https://aipipe.org/openrouter/v1/chat/completions \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -H \"Authorization: Bearer $AIPIPE_TOKEN\" \\ -d '{ \"model\": \"google/gemini-2.0-flash-lite-001\", \"messages\": [{ \"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"What is 2 + 2?\"} }] }' curl https://aipipe.org/openai/v1/embeddings \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -H \"Authorization: Bearer $AIPIPE_TOKEN\" \\ -d '{ \"model\": \"text-embedding-3-small\", \"input\": \"What is 2 + 2?\" }'Copy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` Or using llm : ``` llm keys set openai --value $AIPIPE_TOKEN export OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://aipipe.org/openrouter/v1 llm 'What is 2 + 2?' -m openrouter/google/gemini-2.0-flash-lite-001 export OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://aipipe.org/openai/v1 llm embed -c 'What is 2 + 2' -m 3-smallCopy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` For a 50% discount (but slower speed), use Flex processing by adding service_tier: \"flex\" to your JSON request.

Data Sourcing\" original_url: \"https://tds.s-anand.net/#/data-sourcing?id=data-sourcing\" downloaded_at: \"2025-11-17T01:51:42.199665\" Data Sourcing Before you do any kind of data science, you obviously have to get the data to be able to analyze it, visualize it, narrate it, and deploy it. And what we are going to cover in this module is how you get the data. There are three ways you can get the data. The first is you can download the data. Either somebody gives you the data and says download it from here, or you are asked to download it from the internet because it’s a public data source. But that’s the first way—you download the data. The second way is you can query it from somewhere. It may be on a database. It may be available through an API. It may be available through a library. But these are ways in which you can selectively query parts of the data and stitch it together. The third way is you have to scrape it . It’s not directly available in a convenient form that you can query or download. But it is, in fact, on a web page. It’s available on a PDF file. It’s available in a Word document. It’s available on an Excel file. It’s kind of structured, but you will have to figure out that structure and extract it from there. In this module, we will be looking at the tools that will help you either download from a data source or query from an API or from a database or from a library. And finally, how you can scrape from different sources.

These tools provide intelligent code completion, chat interfaces, and automated refactoring capabilities that dramatically increase developer productivity. In this module, you’ll learn: Copy-paste workflows : Fast iteration cycles using web-based AI assistants for quick fixes and code generation GitHub Copilot : The industry-standard AI pair programmer for VS Code and other editors Cursor : An AI-native editor with advanced context understanding and agent capabilities Windsurf : The first agentic IDE with deep codebase awareness and collaborative AI features Copy-paste workflows The simplest and often most effective AI coding workflow involves copying code and errors to web-based AI assistants, then pasting the improved solutions back into your editor. This approach works with any editor and provides access to the latest AI models. Basic workflow Copy your code and context : Select the problematic code, relevant error messages, and any necessary surrounding context. Include file names, function purposes, and specific requirements in your copy. Paste into AI chat : Use ChatGPT , Claude.ai , Gemini , Qwen , DeepSeek , or similar web interfaces. Be specific about what you want: “Fix this bug”, “Optimize this function”, “Add error handling”, etc. Review and paste back : Carefully review the AI’s suggestions before pasting back into your editor. AI responses may not account for your full codebase context. Essential safety practices Always run linters and tests : After pasting AI-generated code, immediately run your linters, type checkers, and test suites. This catches syntax errors, type mismatches, and broken functionality. Avoid context drift : AI assistants don’t remember your full codebase. Include relevant imports, type definitions, and function signatures when asking for help with complex code. Version control everything : Commit your working code before applying AI suggestions. This gives you an easy rollback path if the AI changes break something unexpected. Best use cases Quick bug fixes : Copy error messages and the surrounding code for fast debugging Code refactoring : Get suggestions for cleaner, more efficient implementations Documentation : Generate comments and docstrings for existing functions Learning new patterns : Understand unfamiliar code by asking for explanations GitHub Copilot GitHub Copilot is the most widely adopted AI coding assistant, seamlessly integrated into VS Code, JetBrains IDEs, and other popular editors. It provides real-time code suggestions and has evolved into a comprehensive AI development platform. Copilot uses OpenAI’s models trained specifically on code repositories, making it exceptionally good at understanding programming patterns and suggesting contextually relevant completions. Key features Ghost text completions : As you type, Copilot suggests code completions in gray text. Press Tab to accept the full suggestion, or Ctrl+→ (Windows/Linux) / Cmd+→ (Mac) to accept word by word. Inline chat ( Ctrl+I ) : Ask Copilot to generate or modify code directly in your editor. This is perfect for writing new functions or refactoring existing code with natural language instructions. Chat panel : Open a dedicated chat interface to discuss your code, ask questions, and get explanations. Access with Ctrl+Shift+I or the Copilot icon in the activity bar. Code actions : Right-click on selected code to access Copilot-powered actions like “Explain this”, “Generate tests”, or “Fix with Copilot”. Tips and tricks Use descriptive variable names : Copilot uses variable and function names as context clues. user_data will get better suggestions than data . Write clear comments : Start functions with comments describing what they should do. Copilot often generates complete implementations from good comments. Accept suggestions incrementally : Use Ctrl+→ to accept partial suggestions instead of the full completion. This gives you more control over the generated code. Toggle Copilot strategically : Click the Copilot icon in the status bar to disable it for specific files or languages where you want to practice coding without assistance. Leverage the command palette : Use Ctrl+Shift+P and search “Copilot” to access all available commands, including explain code, generate tests, and suggest improvements. Copilot Best Practices (What Not To Do) GitHub Copilot Chat Cookbook GitHub Copilot keyboard shortcuts Cursor Cursor is an AI-native code editor built specifically for AI-powered development. It combines the familiar VS Code interface with advanced AI capabilities, offering superior context understanding and multi-file editing. Cursor differentiates itself through proprietary models trained specifically for code editing and its ability to understand entire codebases, not just individual files. Key features Tab autocomplete : Powered by proprietary models that predict multi-line edits and can suggest changes across multiple files simultaneously. More advanced than traditional autocomplete. Composer (Agent mode Ctrl+I ) : An AI agent that can make complex, multi-file changes end-to-end. It finds relevant files, applies changes, and can even run terminal commands with your approval. Chat with codebase ( @ mentions) : Reference specific files, functions, or code symbols using @ syntax. This gives the AI precise context about your codebase structure. Image support : Drag images into the chat to include visual context. Useful for implementing UI designs or debugging visual issues. Web search ( @Web ) : Get up-to-date information from the internet. Helpful for finding current API documentation or solving recent technology issues. Advanced capabilities Smart rewrites : Type carelessly and Cursor fixes your mistakes automatically, understanding intent even from rough input. Multi-file context : Cursor can understand relationships between files and suggest changes that maintain consistency across your entire project. Terminal integration ( Ctrl+K in terminal) : Write terminal commands in plain English and Cursor converts them to the appropriate shell commands. Error detection and fixes : Automatically detects lint errors and applies fixes, reducing manual debugging time. Tips and tricks Use precise @ references : Instead of explaining context, use @filename or @function_name to give Cursor exact context about what you’re working with. Leverage Tab navigation : Press Tab to jump through multi-line suggestions, allowing you to accept parts of complex changes incrementally. Customize instructions : Set up project-specific instructions to teach Cursor about your coding style, frameworks, and conventions. Trust but verify : Cursor’s agent mode is powerful but always review changes before accepting them, especially in production code. 7 Cursor Hacks to become the FASTEST coder Why I QUIT VS Code for Cursor AI Cursor Documentation Windsurf Windsurf is the first agentic IDE, built to keep developers in flow state.

Custom instructions : Honors .github/copilot-instructions.md , nested instruction files, and per-task AGENTS.md guides to steer behavior. Model flexibility : Defaults to Claude Sonnet 4 but can target GPT-5 or other approved models by setting COPILOT_MODEL or using CLI config. Slash commands (popular) /login : Authenticate with GitHub when the session isn’t already linked. /add-dir : Trust and add additional directories for the running session. /cwd : Switch the working directory without restarting. /mcp add : Register extra MCP servers so Copilot can call domain-specific tools. Gemini CLI Gemini CLI is an open‑source, terminal‑first agent for Google’s Gemini models. It supports multimodal inputs, built‑in tools (file ops, shell, web fetch/search), MCP, and a non‑interactive mode for scripts. Core workflow Interactive or one‑shot : Start gemini in a repo, or run gemini -p \"...\" for non‑interactive scans and sub‑agent calls. You can also pipe input: echo \"Explain this code\" | gemini . Large context : Gemini 2.5 Pro supports very large context windows—use it to reason over big codebases and long documents. Built‑in tools : Use web grounding, file operations, and shell commands directly from the CLI when approved. Examples ``` Analyze many files via stdin find . -name \"*.py\" -exec cat {} + | uvx files-to-prompt | gemini -p \"Analyze this Python codebase for architectural issues\" One‑shot prompt (non‑interactive) gemini -p \"Summarize key design decisions from README.md and docs/\" One‑shot from JSON params (reads .prompt) gemini -p \"$(jq -r .prompt prompt.json)\"Copy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` Security and tool execution Approval mode : Control auto‑exec. Use --approval-mode default|auto_edit|yolo (or --yolo ) and consider --allowed-tools for trusted tools. After upgrades or config changes, verify these settings—avoid unintended YOLO. Confirm tool calls : Review proposed shell/file/web actions before approving. Use restrictive profiles when working with untrusted code. Isolated processing : Prefer containerized environments for risky analyses. Enable --sandbox or project Docker sandbox as needed. Slash commands (popular) /help (or /? ): List commands and usage. Tip: use this to discover shortcuts quickly. /chat save|resume|list|delete : Conversation checkpoints. Tip: tag states before big refactors; resume later. /directory add|show : Manage additional workspace roots. Tip: add multiple packages in a monorepo. /mcp [desc|schema] : Inspect configured MCP servers and tools. Tip: use desc to see tool descriptions. /memory add|show|clear|export : Manage hierarchical GEMINI.md memory. Tip: keep global guidance minimal; prefer project‑local. /init : Generate a tailored GEMINI.md for the current repo. Tip: run once per project to prime behavior. /clear and /copy : Clear screen or copy last output. Tip: Ctrl+L also clears. Simon Willison’s llm llm is the ultimate shell-native AI tool, designed specifically for UNIX workflows and pipeline integration. It excels at connecting AI capabilities with traditional command-line tools and automation scripts. Core philosophy Shell-native design : Built from the ground up to work seamlessly with pipes, redirects, and standard UNIX tools. Every feature is designed to integrate naturally with shell scripting. Pipeline integration : Pipe any shell output directly to AI models for processing, analysis, or transformation without temporary files or complex setup. Extensive logging : Every interaction is automatically logged to SQLite, providing full audit trails and the ability to analyze usage patterns over time. Essential commands ``` Basic AI integration llm \"Write a single line bash script to backup my home directory\" Git workflow integration git diff | llm \"Write a Conventional Commit message from this diff\" Security analysis pipeline uvx files-to-prompt codebase/ | llm \"Find security issues and rank by severity\" Audio processing llm -m gemini-2.5-flash \"Transcribe and clean up this audio\" -a meeting.mp3 Structured data extraction llm \"Extract contact information as JSON\" -a business_card.jpg --schema \"name,email,phone\"Copy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` Advanced features Templates : Save and reuse complex prompts (optionally with system prompts, model, options, schema, and fragments) for consistent, reproducible pipelines. ``` Save a template (bundles system + defaults) llm --system 'Review for bugs, performance, security, readability' --save code-review Use the template on stdin cat auth.py | llm -t code-reviewCopy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` Tool calling (0.26+) : Expose safe Python functions as tools that models can call across providers that support tools (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, etc.). Great for grep/tests/format hooks. ``` Try default tools (built-in) llm -T llm_version -T llm_time 'Report LLM version and current time' --td Inline Python functions as tools llm --functions 'def reverse_string(s: str) -> str: \"\"\"Return the reversed string.\"\"\" return s[::-1] ' -T reverse_string 'Reverse this: $input' Example: expose a tiny grep helper (use cautiously) llm --functions ' import subprocess, shlex def grep(pattern: str, path: str = \".\") -> str: \"\"\"Run ripgrep recursively and return matches.\"\"\" cmd = f\"rg -n --no-heading {shlex.quote(pattern)} {shlex.quote(path)}\" return subprocess.run(cmd, shell=True, capture_output=True, text=True).stdout ' -T grep 'Find TODOs in this repo and summarize'Copy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` Fragments : Store large, reusable context once and reference it across commands; reduces tokens and can enable vendor prompt caching. ``` Store large context once (set an alias) llm fragments set large-codebase ./docs/architecture.md Reference that fragment in future prompts llm -f large-codebase \"Optimize the authentication logic\"Copy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` Logging and caching SQLite logs : Every run is logged to a local SQLite DB. Filter, export, and audit. ``` Recent runs (short view) and JSON with fragments expanded llm logs -s | head -n 10 llm logs -c --json --expand | jq '.[] | {when: .datetime_utc, model: .model, prompt: .prompt | tostring}' Filter by fragment or tool usage llm logs -c -f large-codebase --short llm logs -c --tools llm_timeCopy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` Prompt caching : Using -f/--fragment stores large, repeated context once and may leverage vendor prompt caches to cut cost.

Flags like --dangerously-skip-permissions (Claude Code) or --dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox (Codex CLI) disable safety checks and can execute arbitrary commands on your system. Cost and telemetry monitoring Monitor usage patterns : Track API costs, rate limits, and usage patterns to optimize your AI workflows. ``` LLM usage tracking llm logs list --csv > usage_report.csv Cost analysis llm logs --since \"last week\" | awk '{sum+=$tokens} END {print \"Total tokens:\", sum}'Copy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` Set up rate limiting : Configure tools to respect API limits and avoid unexpected charges. Log analysis tools : Use ccusage for Claude Code, built‑in logging for Codex CLI ( ~/.codex/log/ ), or llm logs for comprehensive usage reports. Remote and background execution Remote containers : Run long‑running AI tasks in containers or remote runners to avoid blocking your local machine. Background processing : Use screen, tmux, or systemd services for AI agents that need to run continuously. ``` Background AI monitoring screen -dmS ai-monitor llm --streaming \"Monitor system logs\" < /var/log/syslogCopy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` Keep host clean : Avoid installing large AI dependencies on your development machine by using containerized execution. GitHub integration PR review automation : Set up “@claude” or similar bots for automated code review via GitHub Actions. ``` GitHub Actions workflow name: AI Code Review on: pull_request jobs: review: runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: - uses: actions/checkout@v2 - run: git diff | llm \"Review this PR: summarize risks and changes\" | gh pr comment --body-file -Copy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` Issue triage : Automate issue classification and initial response using AI agents. Commit message generation : Integrate AI-powered commit message generation into git hooks. CI/CD integration Automated code review : Add AI-powered code review steps to your CI/CD pipeline using llm , Claude Code, or Codex CLI. ``` Pre-commit hook example !/bin/bash git diff --cached | llm \"Check for obvious bugs or issues\" --exit-codeCopy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` Changelog generation : Automatically generate changelogs from commit messages and PR descriptions. Security scanning : Integrate AI-powered security analysis into your deployment pipeline. Documentation updates : Automatically update documentation when code changes using AI analysis of diffs. Reproducible workflows Bootstrap scripts : Create setup scripts that configure AI tools with consistent settings across environments. ``` !/bin/bash setup-ai-tools.sh llm install llm-anthropic llm-gemini llm keys set openai $OPENAI_KEY llm templates save code-review \"Review for bugs, performance, security\"Copy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` Environment templates : Use .env templates and configuration files to ensure consistent AI tool behavior across team members. Fast linters and tests : Integrate AI tools with existing linting and testing infrastructure so they follow the same quality gates. Pre-commit hooks : Set up pre-commit hooks that run AI-powered checks automatically, ensuring consistent code quality. These CLI tools represent the cutting edge of AI-powered development workflows, enabling unprecedented automation and productivity gains for developers willing to invest in command-line proficiency.

    "text": "title: \"AI coding strategies\" original_url: \"https://tds.s-anand.net/#/ai-coding-strategies?id=code-review-automation\" downloaded_at: \"2025-11-17T01:52:39.545354\" AI Coding Strategies Strategic approaches to AI-assisted software development have evolved rapidly in 2025. Unlike simple code completion, these methodologies focus on sustainable, team-oriented workflows that maximize AI productivity while maintaining code quality and developer control. Modern AI coding strategies combine human expertise with AI capabilities through structured patterns, parallel processing, and iterative feedback loops. The most effective approaches treat AI as a collaborative partner rather than a replacement, establishing clear boundaries and verification processes. In this module, you’ll learn: Mixture-of-Agents (MoA) : Running multiple AI models in parallel for higher success rates Test-driven AI development : Using automated tests to validate and select AI-generated code Parallel drafting patterns : Generating multiple solutions simultaneously and benchmarking results Reset-over-repair workflows : Strategic session management and context preservation Voice-to-code workflow This is an emerging approach: coding while walking. Matt Webb (Interconnected): records on Apple Watch with Whisper Memos while running. At home, he pastes the transcript to Claude. Diane, I wrote a lecture by talking about it Simon Willison uses AI-powered voice interfaces like ChatGPT’s Voice Mode to code while walking a dog. Notes on using LLMs for code Anand S uses Codex “Dictate” to speak edits required to a repositoring and has it code a pull request while walking. Turning Walks into Pull Requests Not all kinds of coding work well for this. It’s best for: Documentation . Low risk, boring. LLMs do this well. Adding tests . Low risk, boring. LLMs do this moderately well. Coding from examples . Medium risk, slightly boring. LLMs copy well from examples. For refactoring, bug fixing, or new features, it works well when you have robust automated test cases and can review the output easily while walking. Meta-prompting & optimization Using LLMs to optimize prompts before execution can reduce confusion. For example: ``` First agent refines the prompt npx -y @openai/codex exec \"Write a specific, actionable prompt to fix the login bug\"Copy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` This generates a detailed prompt, e.g.: Role : You are a senior backend engineer working in the … Goals : … Constraints : … Implement : … Tests (write first) : … Acceptance criteria : … Pass this prompt to a coding agent to generate the code changes. This increases the chance of success in a single-shot . There are specialized prompt optimization tools like OpenAI’s Prompt Optimizer . You could also use ChatGPT , Claude , etc. to refine your prompt. But using a coding agent lets it see your context directly. Sub-agents Coding agent context windows fill up fast, leading to forgotten functions, broken suggestions, and inefficiency. Sub-agents are a way around this. Instead of using the same agent thread, it spawns tasks to dedicated agents for specialized tasks (e.g., file creation, git commits, running tests). Each runs in its own context window, so their token usage doesn’t drain the main agent’s memory. Claude Code has native Subagents support. To add a new sub-agent, just type /agent and explain what it should do, along with the tools it has access to. You can now use it. Parallel agents Running multiple AI models in parallel (in the background) can have several benefits. On approach is to perform different tasks in parallel. For example: Ask and Code : Run two coding models side-by-side (e.g. Claude Code on two windows). Use one to plan, ask questions, improve the prompt, and other read-only operations. Use the other to generate code. Useful to reduce context size and get single-shot success. Parallel generation : Run two coding models side-by-side. Each works on a different, independent task. For example, one codes the backend while the other codes the frontend. Staged aggregation : Use one model to generate multiple solution approaches, then a second model to evaluate and select the best combination. Another approach is to have multiple models work on the same task, generating different solutions that can be compared and evaluated. For example, Codex lets you draft up to 4 variations using the same prompt. Here are ways to use this: Multi-architecture generation : Run the same prompt in parallel, comparing different architectures. For example: Library alternatives : Request implementations using different libraries or frameworks (React vs Vue, FastAPI vs Django) for the same feature. Algorithm variations : Generate multiple algorithmic approaches (recursive vs iterative, caching vs recomputation) and benchmark performance. Design pattern options : Explore different architectural patterns (Repository, Factory, Observer) for the same business logic. Prompt variations : Generate multiple versions of the same prompt with different framing, then select the best result or combine approaches. Test-driven AI development Test-driven AI development uses automated tests as both specification and validation for AI-generated code. Instead of manually reviewing AI output, you write tests first and let the AI iterate until all tests pass. Typed-first development : Prefer TypeScript, Rust, Go, or typed Python to give AI compile-time guardrails that catch errors early, while linting or compiling. Write (failing) tests first : Before generating implementation code, ask AI to create comprehensive tests covering normal cases, edge cases, and error conditions. Test invariants : Generate tests that verify invariants and properties rather than specific outputs, making them more robust against AI creativity. Loop until green : Use AI to iteratively fix code until all tests pass, rather than trying to get it right in one shot. Observability-driven post-mortems : Log AI decisions, tool usage, and success rates. Have LLMs review and sugges what patterns work best for your team and codebase. Set up the environment and provide instructions for the agent to be able to run the tests at one shot. Use popular test frameworks (pytest, jest, playwright). They have rich features and agents have less to learn. Prefer automated test tools over writing test code, e.g. linters, type checkers, SAST/DAST, coverage/mutation tools. Introduce these in the CI pipeline. Keep tests fast. Run lint && test on every agent response. Cache. Prioritize quick property/unit tests. Reset over repair When AI-generated code starts to drift from requirements or introduces subtle bugs, it’s often faster to restart with clear requirements than to guide the AI through incremental fixes. Session boundaries : Start fresh AI sessions for new features rather than accumulating context drift over long conversations. Checkpoint patterns : Save working implementations before attempting modifications, enabling quick rollback. Scope isolation : Keep changes small and independently verifiable rather than allowing AI to make sweeping modifications. Fast feedback loops Optimize development environment for speed (instant builds, hot reload, fast tests) since slow feedback kills AI productivity more than almost any other factor. Instant builds : Choose technologies and tools with minimal build times to enable rapid iteration and comparison. Hot reload workflows : Use development tools that provide immediate feedback on code changes (Vite, Next.js dev mode, uvicorn –reload). Checkpoint commits : Make git commits at stable states before attempting complex changes, enabling easy rollback if AI suggestions go off track. Automated comparison : Set up CI pipelines that automatically benchmark and compare different implementations on every commit. Code review automation Using a second AI model to evaluate, grade, and select code produced by other AI models creates an automated quality control system that can operate at scale. Multi-criteria evaluation : Configure AI reviewers to assess code across multiple dimensions: correctness, security, performance, maintainability, and style compliance. Rubric-based scoring : Provide specific scoring criteria and examples of high/low quality code to ensure consistent evaluation. Consensus mechanisms : Use multiple AI reviewers and require agreement or vote-based selection for high-stakes changes. Human review protocols : Define clear criteria for when AI-generated code needs human review vs when it can be auto-merged based on test passing. AI coding strategies represent a fundamental shift from individual productivity tools to systematic development methodologies. The most successful teams treat AI as a force multiplier that amplifies human expertise rather than a replacement for engineering judgment.

The goal is not to spray every binary into the sandbox, but to focus on fast, auditable utilities that agents can compose for data prep, testing, review, and automation. Keep the happy path linear: expose tools, document how to call them, and wire safe defaults before inviting an agent into the repo. In this module, you’ll learn: Agent surfaces : Where to document available tools (AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, custom instructions) Safeguards : Least-privilege scopes, approvals, and auditable shells Data + storage : JSON/YAML/CSV wranglers and embedded databases for evals Python feedback loop : Environment hygiene, lint/test/type tooling Automation reach : GitHub, comms, web, cloud, multi-agent, and ingestion helpers Agent configuration surfaces Spell out available tooling where agents read first: AGENTS.md , CLAUDE.md , custom instructions : Document approved commands, required flags, and escalation policies. Keep the happy path obvious (“Use uv run ruff check before proposing fixes”). Per-agent config : For Codex/Gemini/Claude, pair repo instructions with personal custom instructions so agents know global conventions (e.g., “Call gh run watch to follow workflows”). Promptable snippets : Store reusable shell recipes in prompts/ or ~/.codex/prompts/ so agents can slot them into responses without re-deriving them. Least-privilege automation Guardrails keep autonomous edits predictable: Per-tool scopes : Use Codex/Gemini approval modes ( /approvals , --allowed-tools ) to restrict filesystem, network, and exec surfaces until trust is built. Auditable shells : Route shell calls through wrappers like bin/approved-ls (whitelisted flags) and capture transcripts in logs/ . MCP servers provide a structured way to do this. Workflow rehearsals : Force dry-run checks ( terraform plan , gh workflow run --dry-run ) before greenlighting mutating commands. Agents should see the rehearsal command in instructions. GitHub automation The gh CLI gives agents production-grade git reach: ``` Stage a release branch and push with review requests gh pr create --base main --fill --reviewer \"@team/reviewers\" gh workflow run ci.yml --ref feature/agent-generated Inspect checks before merging gh pr checks --watchCopy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` Encourage agents to: Use gh issue status , gh pr view --web , and gh run watch to gather context instead of scraping raw HTML. Call gh api repos/:owner/:repo/commits --paginate for structured history when diff context is too large for a prompt. Communication hooks Keep human-in-the-loop chat within CLI reach: Slack CLI ( slack ) : Pair agents with slack chat send --channel dev-ai --text \"Tests passed on $(git rev-parse --short HEAD)\" so notifications land in the right room. Configure bot tokens with read/send-only scopes. Jira automation : Tools like go-jira let agents mirror status updates ( jira issue edit KEY-123 --assign agent-bot ). Fence them with issue-specific permissions. Data wrangling pipelines Give agents deterministic ways to slice structured data before it hits the model: jq : The Swiss army knife for JSON. Example: cat eval-log.json | jq '.runs[] | select(.status==\"failed\") | {id, stderr}' to isolate failing tool calls. ( jqlang/jq README ) yq (kislyuk) : YAML⇄JSON bridge that reuses jq filters. yq -Y '.contexts[] | select(.name==\"staging\")' kubeconfig.yaml keeps tags intact. yq (mikefarah) : Native multi-format processor. Use yq '.services[] | select(.port==6379)' compose.yml or merge manifests with yq ea '. as $item ireduce ({}; . * $item )' charts/*.yaml . xsv / csvkit : For columnar stats and sampling. xsv stats metrics.csv is near-instant; fall back to csvsql or csvstat when you need richer transforms. pandoc : Convert specs into Markdown for prompts: pandoc docs/spec.docx -t gfm -o tmp/spec.md . Local databases & analytics Fast, reproducible stores let agents validate work without external services: SQLite ( sqlite3 ) : Ship miniature fixtures with sqlite3 fixtures.db < schema.sql and query via MCP. sqlite-utils : Import JSON quickly: uv run sqlite-utils insert eval.db runs runs.json --pk id . Use sqlite-utils tables eval.db --counts to sanity-check load results. ( README ) DuckDB : Columnar analytics for Parquet/CSV. duckdb :memory: \"SELECT repo, COUNT(*) FROM 'logs.parquet' GROUP BY 1 ORDER BY 2 DESC LIMIT 10\" keeps evals local. ( DuckDB README ) Datasette : Publish SQLite artifacts for reviewer inspection: datasette serve eval.db --metadata metadata.json . ( Datasette README ) Redis : Use a scoped Redis instance ( redis-cli --scan limited to agent:* ) for lock coordination and rate limits; document the allowed keys in your instructions. Python environment hygiene Agents thrive with fast, reproducible Python workflows: uv (Astral) : Replace pip / virtualenv / pip-tools . uv sync --frozen keeps dependency drift out, while uv run pytest is the preferred way to execute scripts. ( uv README ) pipx : Install Python CLIs ( pipx install sqlite-utils ) so agents can call them without polluting project envs. pyenv : Pin interpreter versions ( pyenv local 3.12.3 ) and mention them in AGENTS.md . pre-commit : Enforce lint/format/test hooks before commits. Attach .pre-commit-config.yaml to repo instructions and encourage pre-commit run --all-files after agent edits.

Google Auth is the most commonly implemented single sign-on mechanism because: It’s popular and user-friendly. Users can log in with their existing Google accounts. It’s secure: Google supports OAuth2 and OpenID Connect to handle authentication. Here’s how you build a FastAPI app that identifies the user. Go to the Google Cloud Console – Credentials and click Create Credentials > OAuth client ID . Choose Web application , set your authorized redirect URIs (e.g., http://localhost:8000/ ). Copy the Client ID and Client Secret into a .env file: GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id.apps.googleusercontent.com GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secretCopy to clipboardErrorCopied 4. Create your FastAPI app.py : ``` /// script dependencies = [\"python-dotenv\", \"fastapi\", \"uvicorn\", \"itsdangerous\", \"httpx\", \"authlib\"] /// import os from dotenv import load_dotenv from fastapi import FastAPI, Request from fastapi.responses import RedirectResponse from starlette.middleware.sessions import SessionMiddleware from authlib.integrations.starlette_client import OAuth load_dotenv() app = FastAPI() app.add_middleware(SessionMiddleware, secret_key=\"create-a-random-secret-key\") oauth = OAuth() oauth.register( name=\"google\", client_id=os.getenv(\"GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID\"), client_secret=os.getenv(\"GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET\"), server_metadata_url=\"https://accounts.google.com/.well-known/openid-configuration\", client_kwargs={\"scope\": \"openid email profile\"}, ) @app.get(\"/\") async def application(request: Request): user = request.session.get(\"user\") # 3.

It’s essential when you need to transmit binary data through text-only channels or embed binary content in text formats. Watch this quick explanation of how Base64 works (3 min): Here’s how it works: It takes 3 bytes (24 bits) and converts them into 4 ASCII characters … using 64 characters: A-Z, a-z, 0-9, + and / (padding with = to make the length a multiple of 4) There’s a URL-safe variant of Base64 that replaces + and / with - and _ to avoid issues in URLs Base64 adds ~33% overhead (since every 3 bytes becomes 4 characters) Common Python operations with Base64: ``` import base64 Basic encoding/decoding text = \"Hello, World!\" Convert text to base64 encoded = base64.b64encode(text.encode()).decode() # SGVsbG8sIFdvcmxkIQ== Convert base64 back to text decoded = base64.b64decode(encoded).decode() # Hello, World! Convert to URL-safe base64 url_safe = base64.urlsafe_b64encode(text.encode()).decode() # SGVsbG8sIFdvcmxkIQ== Working with binary files (e.g., images) with open('image.png', 'rb') as f: binary_data = f.read() image_b64 = base64.b64encode(binary_data).decode() Data URI example (embed images in HTML/CSS) data_uri = f\"data:image/png;base64,{image_b64}\"Copy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` Data URIs allow embedding binary data directly in HTML/CSS. This reduces the number of HTTP requests and also works offline. But it increases the file size. For example, here’s an SVG image embedded as a data URI: <img src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAzMiAzMiI+PGNpcmNsZSBjeD0iMTYiIGN5PSIxNiIgcj0iMTUiIGZpbGw9IiMyNTYzZWIiLz48cGF0aCBmaWxsPSIjZmZmIiBkPSJtMTYgNyAyIDcgNyAyLTcgMi0yIDctMi03LTctMiA3LTJaIi8+PC9zdmc+\" />Copy to clipboardErrorCopied Base64 is used in many places: JSON: Encoding binary data in JSON payloads Email: MIME attachments encoding Auth: HTTP Basic Authentication headers JWT: Encoding tokens in web authentication SSL/TLS: PEM certificate format SAML: Encoding assertions in SSO Git: Encoding binary files in patches Tools for working with Base64: Base64 Decoder/Encoder for online encoding/decoding data: URI Generator converts files to Data URIs [Previous LLM Text Extraction](#/llm-text-extraction) [Next Embeddings](#/embeddings)",

Unlike general prompt engineering, code context engineering focuses specifically on code-related workflows, project structure, and development processes. Effective context engineering transforms AI from a simple code generator into an intelligent development partner that understands your project’s architecture, conventions, and goals. In this module, you’ll learn: File context : Techniques for providing relevant code snippets and files to AI tools Spec-first development : Using a specification document as the single source of truth for AI-driven development Project context : Using CLAUDE.md or AGENTS.md to give AI persistent knowledge about your codebase Library context : Supplying documentation for third-party libraries to improve AI understanding Project documentation : Generating and maintaining human and AI-readable docs for better collaboration llms.txt : Implementing the llms.txt standard to help LLMs understand your website or API Instruction templates : Using lightweight schemas to eliminate ambiguity in prompts Best practices and tips : Maintaining context hygiene, cost optimization, and team collaboration File context The easiest way to provide context to AI is by copy-pasting or uploading the code directly. For single files, this is straightforward. For multi-file projects, you can use: uvx files-to-prompt --cxml file1.py file2.js repo/ ...Copy to clipboardErrorCopied This concatenates the files into an XML structure (recommended by Claude, supported by most AI tools) that you can paste or pass to your AI tool. For small files, this works well. If your code is large, you may want to pass files and chunks selectively. For git repositories, you can use gitingest . For example https://gitingest.com/sanand0/tools-in-data-science-public extracts the full contents of this course repo. You may use it in the command line like this: uvx gitingest https://github.com/sanand0/tools-in-data-science-publicCopy to clipboardErrorCopied Spec-first development Spec-first development places a detailed specification document at the center of your AI coding workflow. Instead of giving ad-hoc instructions to AI tools, you maintain a living spec that serves as the authoritative source for project requirements, constraints, and acceptance criteria. There is no formal standard for AI coding specs. Here are some sections you might want to include in your README.md (or a separate spec.md ): Meta : Status , Version , Owners , Repo/Issue links , Last reviewed Problem & Scope : One-paragraph problem; Goals vs Out-of-scope . Users & Flows : Primary personas; 1–2 happy-path flows; edge cases as bullets. Requirements : Functional & non-functional (latency, cost, availability, privacy). Use MUST/SHOULD/MAY precisely. Interfaces & Data Contracts : REST/GraphQL/event contracts (OpenAPI/GraphQL SDL/AsyncAPI); shared JSON Schemas for requests, responses, events, and errors. Prefer contract-first. AI-Specific Contracts : Prompt & Tool Schemas (inputs/outputs, invariants), strict parsing requirements, safety guardrails, cost, budgets, fallback & timeout policy. If using tool/function calling, document JSON schema + strictness. Acceptance Examples : Executable examples that double as tests. Keep 1 scenario per behavior. Evaluation Plan (for LLM features) : Golden/regression tests, challenge sets, rubrics, and pass/fail gates. Automate. Risk, Safety & Privacy : Threat model & mitigations (e.g. aligned to OWASP LLM Top 10 ); PII handling/redaction rules. Change Log & Versioning : Human-readable changes; link to related ADRs; follow a clear changelog style. Some things to remember: Keep docs as code. Version the spec, run doc linters in CI, and require spec updates for feature PRs (“docs-as-code”). Keep it updated . Update whenever a new decision/change is made. Record decisions, not debates. Change transparently. Maintain a CHANGELOG.md in plain language and link each entry to spec sections / architecture decision records. Avoid bloated specs . Focus on the most important decisions (not reasons). Avoid vagueness . This can confuse AI. Ideally, replace with executable examples. Project context Project context provides AI tools with persistent knowledge about your codebase. Codex uses AGENTS.md Gemini CLI uses GEMINI.md (see “Memory Management” in their docs) Claude Code uses CLAUDE.md Claude Code and Gemini CLI provide a /init command to bootstrap these files based on your project structure and README.md . You can edit the generated file. Each project has its own style and preferences. Most often, these files include instructions on how to build and test the project and coding conventions. Examples of CLAUDE.md on GitHub Examples of AGENTS.md on GitHub Versioning prompts Some developers also version their prompts by adding them to: Commits . When coding with a CLI, you can manually add the prompt(s) used as part of the commit. Pull requests . Online coding agents include a link to the task (which includes the prompt) as part of the PR. Example PROMPTS.md . Developers are increasingly storing prompts in a PROMPTS.md . Examples Commit messages Commit messages provide useful context about code changes, helping AI tools scan through history and understand the intent behind modifications. Most AI coding agents generate commit messages automatically. Here’s a quick way to do it manually: git diff --cached | llm \"Generate a concise, descriptive commit message for these changes\"Copy to clipboardErrorCopied Library context When using libraries (e.g. from PyPI or npm ), providing context about the library can help AI understand it better. You can add this instruction: - Use `curl -s https://pypi.org/pypi/package-name/json | jq -r .info.description` to get PyPI package docs - Use `npm view package-name readme` to get npm package docs - Use `curl -s https://context7.com/owner/repo/llms.txt` for https://github.com/owner/repo docsCopy to clipboardErrorCopied PyPi and NPM provide the first two natively. For GitHub repos, you can create an account on context7.com to add any public GitHub repos you want the docs for. Project documentation Human developers need to understand the codebase to contribute to a project. AI tools can help with this. A simple approach is to use a coding agent to generate documentation from the codebase. Here are examples: uvx files-to-prompt --cxml . | llm \"Generate a comprehensive README.md for this project\" > README.md claude -p \"Update README.md with project overview, setup, and usage examples\" codex exec \"Update README.md with project overview, setup, and usage examples\"Copy to clipboardErrorCopied DeepWiki is a tool that generates documentation from GitHub repos. For example https://deepwiki.com/openai/openai-python has the generated documentation for openai/openai-python https://deepwiki.com/sanand0/tools-in-data-science-public has the generated documentation for this Tools in Data Science course You can replace github.com with deepwiki.com and generate docs for your own public repos. llms.txt /llms.txt is a standard to provide information to help LLMs use a website at inference time. For example: Yoast llms.txt Vercel llms.txt Klarna llms.txt Examples of llms.txt on GitHub Several tools can generate llms.txt files. Context right-sizing : Include only the essential information that AI needs for current tasks. For large context, you can: Break-it up . OpenAI’s llms.txt is 2.8MB, for example. So they’ve broken it up into llms-models-pricing.txt , llms-guides.txt , and llms-api-reference.txt . Use tool-calling or MCP servers to fetch additional context on demand rather than bloating every prompt. Compress it . Tools like llm-min.txt use LLMs to compress large llms.txt. Or tools that measure prompt ablation to find the most important parts of a prompt. Instruction templates Use lightweight schemas to eliminate ambiguity. For example: ``` Code Review Schema | Aspect | Rating (1-5) | Issues | Suggestions | | --------------- | ------------ | ------ | ----------- | | Security | | | | | Performance | | | | | Maintainability | | | | | Test Coverage | | | | Bug Report Schema Reproduction Steps : [numbered list] Expected Behavior : [one sentence] Actual Behavior : [one sentence] Environment : [OS, browser, version] Logs : [relevant error messages]Copy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` Best practices and tips Context hygiene Version control all context files : Treat CLAUDE.md, spec.md, and related files as first-class code artifacts that should be versioned and reviewed. Keep contexts focused : Resist the urge to include everything. Each context file should serve a specific purpose and audience. Regular context maintenance : Review and update context files as your project evolves. Outdated context can be worse than no context. Cost optimization Monitor token usage : Track how much context you’re including in each AI interaction and optimize for the highest-value information. Use tiered context : Start with minimal context and let AI tools request additional information as needed. Cache common contexts : Store frequently-used project context in AI tool memories to avoid repeating large context blocks. Team collaboration Standardize context formats : Ensure all team members use consistent file names and structures for project context. Share context libraries : Create reusable context templates for common project types and development patterns. Document context decisions : Explain why certain information is included or excluded from project context files.

For example: Content analysis : Extract clean text from HTML for natural language processing Data mining : Strip formatting to focus on the actual content Offline reading : Convert web pages to readable formats for e-readers or offline consumption Content migration : Move content between different CMS platforms SEO analysis : Extract headings, content structure, and text for optimization Archive creation : Store web content in more compact, preservation-friendly formats Accessibility : Convert content to formats that work better with screen readers This tutorial covers both converting existing HTML files and combining web crawling with HTML-to-text conversion in a single workflow – all using the command line. defuddle-cli defuddle-cli specializes in HTML - Markdown conversion. It’s a bit slow and not very customizable but produces clean Markdown that preserves structure, links, and basic formatting. Best for content where preserving the document structure is important. find . -name '*.html' -exec npx --package defuddle-cli -y defuddle parse {} --md -o {}.md \\;Copy to clipboardErrorCopied find . -name '*.html' : Finds all HTML files in the current directory and subdirectories -exec ... \\; : Executes the following command for each file found npx --package defuddle-cli -y : Installs and runs defuddle-cli without prompting defuddle parse {} --md : Parses the HTML file (represented by {} ) and converts to markdown -o {}.md : Outputs to a file with the original name plus .md extension Pandoc Pandoc is a bit slow and highly customizable, preserving almost all formatting elements, leading to verbose markdown. Best for academic or documentation conversion where precision matters. Pandoc can convert from many other formats (such as Word, PDF, LaTeX, etc.) to Markdown and vice versa, making it one of most popular and versatile document converters. find . -name '*.html' -exec pandoc -f html -t markdown_strict -o {}.md {} \\;Copy to clipboardErrorCopied find . -name '*.html' : Finds all HTML files in the current directory and subdirectories -exec ... \\; : Executes the following command for each file found pandoc : The Swiss Army knife of document conversion -f html -t markdown_strict : Convert from HTML format to strict markdown -o {}.md {} : Output to a markdown file, with the input file as the last argument Lynx Lynx is fast and generates text (not Markdown) with minimal formatting. Lynx renders the HTML as it would appear in a text browser, preserving basic structure but losing complex formatting. Best for quick content extraction or when processing large numbers of files. find . -type f -name '*.html' -exec sh -c 'for f; do lynx -dump -nolist \"$f\" > \"${f%.html}.txt\"; done' _ {} +Copy to clipboardErrorCopied find . -type f -name '*.html' : Finds all HTML files in the current directory and subdirectories -exec sh -c '...' _ {} + : Executes a shell command with batched files for efficiency for f; do ... done : Loops through each file in the batch lynx -dump -nolist \"$f\" : Uses the lynx text browser to render HTML as plain text -dump : Output the rendered page to stdout -nolist : Don’t include the list of links at the end > \"${f%.html}.txt\" : Save output to a .txt file with the same base name w3m w3m is very slow processing with minimal formatting. w3m tends to be more thorough in its rendering than lynx but takes considerably longer. It supports basic JavaScript processing, making it better at handling modern websites with dynamic content. Best for cases where you need slightly better rendering than lynx, particularly for complex layouts and tables, and when some JavaScript processing is beneficial. find . -type f -name '*.html' \\ -exec sh -c 'for f; do \\ w3m -dump -T text/html -cols 80 -no-graph \"$f\" > \"${f%.html}.md\"; \\ done' _ {} +Copy to clipboardErrorCopied find . -type f -name '*.html' : Finds all HTML files in the current directory and subdirectories -exec sh -c '...' _ {} + : Executes a shell command with batched files for efficiency for f; do ... done : Loops through each file in the batch w3m -dump -T text/html -cols 80 -no-graph \"$f\" : Uses the w3m text browser to render HTML -dump : Output the rendered page to stdout -T text/html : Specify input format as HTML -cols 80 : Set output width to 80 columns -no-graph : Don’t show graphic characters for tables and frames > \"${f%.html}.md\" : Save output to a .md file with the same base name Comparison | Approach | Speed | Format Quality | Preservation | Best For | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | defuddle-cli | Slow | High | Good structure and links | Content migration, publishing | | pandoc | Slow | Very High | Almost everything | Academic papers, documentation | | lynx | Fast | Low | Basic structure only | Quick extraction, large batches | | w3m | Very Slow | Medium-Low | Basic structure with better tables | Improved readability over lynx | Optimize Batch Processing Process in parallel : Use GNU Parallel for multi-core processing: find . -name \"*.html\" | parallel \"pandoc -f html -t markdown_strict -o {}.md {}\"Copy to clipboardErrorCopied 2. Filter files before processing : find . -name \"*.html\" -type f -size -1M -exec pandoc -f html -t markdown {} -o {}.md \\;Copy to clipboardErrorCopied 3.

Use the lynx approach Need precise, complete conversion? Use pandoc Need a balance of structure and cleanliness? Try defuddle-cli Working with complex tables? w3m might render them better Remember that the best approach depends on your specific use case, volume of files, and how you intend to use the converted text. Combined Crawling and Conversion Sometimes you need to both crawl a website and convert its content to markdown or text in a single workflow, like Crawl4AI or markdown-crawler . For research/data collection : Use a specialized crawler (like Crawl4AI) with post-processing conversion For simple website archiving : Markdown-crawler provides a convenient all-in-one solution For high-quality conversion : Use wget/wget2 for crawling followed by pandoc for conversion For maximum speed : Combine wget with lynx in a pipeline Crawl4AI Crawl4AI is designed for single-page extraction with high-quality content processing. Crawl4AI is optimized for AI training data extraction, focusing on clean, structured content rather than complete site preservation. It excels at removing boilerplate content and preserving the main article text. uv venv source .venv/bin/activate.fish uv pip install crawl4ai crawl4ai-setupCopy to clipboardErrorCopied uv venv : Creates a Python virtual environment using uv (a faster alternative to virtualenv) source .venv/bin/activate.fish : Activates the virtual environment (fish shell syntax) uv pip install crawl4ai : Installs the crawl4ai package crawl4ai-setup : Initializes crawl4ai’s required dependencies markdown-crawler markdown-crawler combines web crawling with markdown conversion in one tool.

This tutorial explores various command-line tools for converting PDFs to Markdown format, with a focus on preserving structure and formatting suitable for different use cases, including preparation for Large Language Models (LLMs). Use Cases: LLM training and fine-tuning : Create clean text data from PDFs for AI model training Knowledge base creation : Transform PDFs into searchable, editable markdown documents Content repurposing : Convert academic papers and reports for web publication Data extraction : Pull structured content from PDF documents for analysis Accessibility : Convert PDFs to more accessible formats for screen readers Citation and reference management : Extract bibliographic information from academic papers Documentation conversion : Transform technical PDFs into maintainable documentation PyMuPDF4LLM PyMuPDF4LLM is a specialized component of the PyMuPDF library that generates Markdown specifically formatted for Large Language Models. It produces high-quality markdown with good preservation of document structure. It’s specifically optimized for producing text that works well with LLMs, removing irrelevant formatting while preserving semantic structure. Requires PyTorch, which adds dependencies but enables more advanced processing capabilities. PyMuPDF4LLM uses MuPDF as its PDF parsing engine. PyMuPDF is emerging as a strong default for PDF text extraction due to its accuracy and performance in handling complex PDF structures. PYTHONUTF8=1 uv run --with pymupdf4llm python -c 'import pymupdf4llm; h = open(\"pymupdf4llm.md\", \"w\"); h.write(pymupdf4llm.to_markdown(\"$FILE.pdf\"))'Copy to clipboardErrorCopied PYTHONUTF8=1 : Forces Python to use UTF-8 encoding regardless of system locale uv run --with pymupdf4llm : Uses uv package manager to run Python with the pymupdf4llm package python -c '...' : Executes Python code directly from the command line import pymupdf4llm : Imports the PDF-to-Markdown module h = open(\"pymupdf4llm.md\", \"w\") : Creates a file to write the markdown output h.write(pymupdf4llm.to_markdown(\"$FILE.pdf\")) : Converts the PDF to markdown and writes to file Markitdown Markitdown is Microsoft’s tool for converting various document formats to Markdown, including PDFs, DOCX, XLSX, PPTX, and ZIP files. It’s a versatile multi-format converter that handles PDFs via PDFMiner, DOCX via Mammoth, XLSX via Pandas, and PPTX via Python-PPTX. Good for batch processing of mixed document types. The quality of PDF conversion is generally good but may struggle with complex layouts or heavily formatted documents. PYTHONUTF8=1 uvx markitdown $FILE.pdf > markitdown.mdCopy to clipboardErrorCopied PYTHONUTF8=1 : Forces Python to use UTF-8 encoding uvx markitdown : Runs the markitdown tool via the uv package manager $FILE.pdf : The input PDF file > markitdown.md : Redirects output to a markdown file Unstructured Unstructured is rapidly becoming the de facto library for parsing over 40 different file types. It is excellent for extracting text and tables from diverse document formats. Particularly useful for generating clean content to pass to LLMs. Strong community support and actively maintained. GROBID If you specifically need to parse references from text-native PDFs or reliably OCR’ed ones, GROBID remains the de facto choice. It excels at extracting structured bibliographic information with high accuracy. ``` Start GROBID service docker run -t --rm -p 8070:8070 lfoppiano/grobid:0.7.2 Process PDF with curl curl -X POST -F \"input=@paper.pdf\" localhost:8070/api/processFulltextDocument > references.tei.xmlCopy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` Mistral OCR API Mistral OCR offers an end-to-end cloud API that preserves both text and layout, making it easier to isolate specific sections like References. It shows the most promise currently, though it requires post-processing. Azure AI Document Intelligence API For enterprise users already in the Microsoft ecosystem, Azure AI Document Intelligence provides excellent raw OCR with enterprise SLAs. May require custom model training or post-processing to match GROBID’s reference extraction capabilities. Other libraries Docling is IBM’s document understanding library that supports PDF conversion. It can be challenging to install, particularly on Windows and some Linux distributions. Offers advanced document understanding capabilities beyond simple text extraction. MegaParse takes a comprehensive approach using LibreOffice, Pandoc, Tesseract OCR, and other tools. It has Robust handling of different document types but requires an OpenAI API key for some features. Good for complex documents but has significant dependencies.

Web crawling is essential in many data-driven scenarios: Data mining and analysis : Gathering structured data from multiple pages for market research, competitive analysis, or academic research Content archiving : Creating offline copies of websites for preservation or backup purposes SEO analysis : Analyzing site structure, metadata, and content to improve search rankings Legal compliance : Capturing website content for regulatory or compliance documentation Website migration : Creating a complete copy before moving to a new platform or design Offline access : Downloading educational resources, documentation, or reference materials for use without internet connection The most commonly used tool for fetching websites is wget . It is pre-installed in many UNIX distributions and easy to install. To crawl the IIT Madras Data Science Program website for example, you could run: wget \\ --recursive \\ --level=3 \\ --no-parent \\ --convert-links \\ --adjust-extension \\ --compression=auto \\ --accept html,htm \\ --directory-prefix=./ds \\ https://study.iitm.ac.in/ds/Copy to clipboardErrorCopied Here’s what each option does: --recursive : Enables recursive downloading (following links) --level=3 : Limits recursion depth to 3 levels from the initial URL --no-parent : Restricts crawling to only URLs below the initial directory --convert-links : Converts all links in downloaded documents to work locally --adjust-extension : Adds proper extensions to files (.html, .jpg, etc.) based on MIME types --compression=auto : Automatically handles compressed content (gzip, deflate) --accept html,htm : Only downloads files with these extensions --directory-prefix=./ds : Saves all downloaded files to the specified directory wget2 is a better version of wget and supports HTTP2, parallel connections, and only updates modified sites.

You’ll often access databases created by others for analysis. PostgreSQL, MySQL, MS SQL, Oracle, etc. are popular databases. But the most installed database is SQLite . It’s embedded into many devices and apps (e.g. your phone, browser, etc.). It’s lightweight but very scalable and powerful. Watch these introductory videos to understand SQLite and how it’s used in Python (34 min): There are many non-relational databases (NoSQL) like ElasticSearch , MongoDB , Redis , etc. that you should know about and we may cover later. Core Concepts: ``` -- Create a table CREATE TABLE users ( id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT NOT NULL, email TEXT UNIQUE, created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ); -- Insert data INSERT INTO users (name, email) VALUES ('Alice', 'alice@example.com'), ('Bob', 'bob@example.com'); -- Query data SELECT name, COUNT(*) as count FROM users GROUP BY name HAVING count > 1; -- Join tables SELECT u.name, o.product FROM users u LEFT JOIN orders o ON u.id = o.user_id WHERE o.status = 'pending';Copy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` Python Integration: ``` import sqlite3 from pathlib import Path import pandas as pd def query_database(db_path: Path, query: str) -> pd.DataFrame: \"\"\"Execute SQL query and return results as DataFrame.\"\"\" with sqlite3.connect(db_path) as conn: return pd.read_sql_query(query, conn) Example usage db = Path('data.db') df = query_database(db, ''' SELECT date, COUNT(*) as count FROM events GROUP BY date ''')Copy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` Common Operations: Database Management ``` -- Backup database .backup 'backup.db' -- Import CSV .mode csv .import data.csv table_name -- Export results .headers on .mode csv .output results.csv SELECT * FROM table;Copy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` 2. Performance Optimization ``` -- Create index CREATE INDEX idx_user_email ON users(email); -- Analyze query EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN SELECT * FROM users WHERE email LIKE '%@example.com'; -- Show indexes SELECT * FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='index';Copy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` 3. Data Analysis ``` -- Time series aggregation SELECT date(timestamp), COUNT(*) as events, AVG(duration) as avg_duration FROM events GROUP BY date(timestamp); -- Window functions SELECT *, AVG(amount) OVER ( PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY date ROWS BETWEEN 3 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW ) as moving_avg FROM transactions;Copy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` Tools to work with SQLite: SQLiteStudio : Lightweight GUI DBeaver : Full-featured GUI sqlite-utils : CLI tool Datasette : Web interface [Previous Spreadsheet: Excel, Google Sheets](#/spreadsheets) [Next Browser: DevTools](#/devtools)",

Created by Simon Willison, it turns any SQLite database into an instant web interface with powerful exploration features, JSON APIs, and visualization capabilities—all without writing code. Unlike traditional database tools that require SQL knowledge upfront, Datasette provides an interactive interface for exploring data through faceting, filtering, and full-text search. It’s particularly powerful for data journalism, analysis workflows, and sharing datasets with non-technical audiences. Installation Install Datasette using pip or uv: ``` pip install datasette or uv tool install datasetteCopy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` Start Datasette with any SQLite database: datasette mydatabase.dbCopy to clipboardErrorCopied This launches a web server at http://localhost:8001 with an instant interface to explore your data. Create a Sample Dataset Let’s create a realistic e-commerce dataset to demonstrate Datasette’s analysis capabilities. This simulates common business patterns: customer orders with regional variations, seasonal trends, and product categories that enable realistic business questions like “Which regions generate the most revenue?” or “What are our seasonal sales patterns?” ``` sqlite3 ecommerce.db <<'SQL' CREATE TABLE customers ( customer_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT, email TEXT, region TEXT, signup_date TEXT ); CREATE TABLE products ( product_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT, category TEXT, price REAL, cost REAL ); CREATE TABLE orders ( order_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, customer_id INTEGER, product_id INTEGER, order_date TEXT, quantity INTEGER, status TEXT, FOREIGN KEY(customer_id) REFERENCES customers(customer_id), FOREIGN KEY(product_id) REFERENCES products(product_id) ); -- Insert sample customers INSERT INTO customers (customer_id, name, email, region, signup_date) SELECT seq, 'Customer ' || seq, 'customer' || seq || '@example.com', CASE (seq % 4) WHEN 0 THEN 'North' WHEN 1 THEN 'South' WHEN 2 THEN 'East' ELSE 'West' END, date('2024-01-01', '+' || (seq % 365) || ' days') FROM ( WITH RECURSIVE cnt(x) AS (SELECT 1 UNION ALL SELECT x+1 FROM cnt LIMIT 100) SELECT x AS seq FROM cnt ); -- Insert sample products INSERT INTO products (product_id, name, category, price, cost) VALUES (1, 'Laptop', 'Electronics', 999.99, 600.00), (2, 'Mouse', 'Electronics', 29.99, 15.00), (3, 'Desk Chair', 'Furniture', 299.99, 150.00), (4, 'Monitor', 'Electronics', 399.99, 200.00), (5, 'Desk Lamp', 'Furniture', 49.99, 20.00), (6, 'Keyboard', 'Electronics', 79.99, 40.00), (7, 'Bookshelf', 'Furniture', 199.99, 100.00), (8, 'Webcam', 'Electronics', 89.99, 45.00); -- Insert sample orders INSERT INTO orders (order_id, customer_id, product_id, order_date, quantity, status) SELECT seq, (seq % 100) + 1, (seq % 8) + 1, date('2024-01-01', '+' || (seq % 365) || ' days'), CASE WHEN random() % 10 < 8 THEN 1 ELSE (random() % 3) + 1 END, CASE (random() % 10) WHEN 0 THEN 'pending' WHEN 1 THEN 'cancelled' ELSE 'completed' END FROM ( WITH RECURSIVE cnt(x) AS (SELECT 1 UNION ALL SELECT x+1 FROM cnt LIMIT 500) SELECT x AS seq FROM cnt ); -- Create indexes for performance CREATE INDEX idx_orders_customer ON orders(customer_id); CREATE INDEX idx_orders_product ON orders(product_id); CREATE INDEX idx_orders_date ON orders(order_date); SQLCopy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` Now launch Datasette to explore this data: datasette ecommerce.dbCopy to clipboardErrorCopied Visit http://localhost:8001 to see your database interface. Understanding the Database Interface When you first open Datasette, you’ll see the database homepage with all available tables, row counts, and a SQL query box. Click any table name (like orders ) to start exploring. The table view shows your data with powerful interactive features: Sort columns by clicking headers Column menus (cog icon) for faceting and filtering Pagination controls for large datasets Using Facets for Discovery Facets show the distribution of values in a column—Datasette’s killer feature for exploratory analysis. Click the cog icon next to status and select “Facet by this”. You’ll see counts like: completed: 400 pending: 50 cancelled: 50 Each count is clickable to filter the data. This instantly answers “How many orders are in each status?” Multiple facets reveal deeper patterns. Facet by status , then add region and product category to see which regions cancel most often or which categories sell best where. Filtering Data Filters drill into specific subsets. Datasette supports: Exact match : ?status__exact=completedCopy to clipboardErrorCopied Text contains : ?name__contains=LaptopCopy to clipboardErrorCopied Numeric comparisons : ?quantity__gt=1Copy to clipboardErrorCopied Date ranges : ?order_date__gte=2024-06-01&order_date__lt=2024-07-01Copy to clipboardErrorCopied Stack filters to answer questions like “Show completed Electronics orders from the North region with quantity > 1”. Running SQL Queries For complex analysis, use the SQL editor. Click “SQL” in the navigation or the query box on the database homepage. Revenue by region : SELECT c.region, COUNT(DISTINCT o.order_id) as orders, SUM(o.quantity * p.price) as revenue, ROUND(AVG(o.quantity * p.price), 2) as avg_order FROM orders o JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id JOIN products p ON o.product_id = p.product_id WHERE o.status = 'completed' GROUP BY c.region ORDER BY revenue DESCCopy to clipboardErrorCopied Top customers : SELECT c.name, c.region, COUNT(o.order_id) as orders, SUM(o.quantity * p.price) as lifetime_value FROM customers c JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id JOIN products p ON o.product_id = p.product_id WHERE o.status = 'completed' GROUP BY c.customer_id ORDER BY lifetime_value DESC LIMIT 10Copy to clipboardErrorCopied Query results can be faceted, filtered, and exported just like tables. Exporting Data Every view exports to CSV, JSON, or newline-delimited JSON. Click .csv or .json links at the bottom of any page. Exports respect your current filters: ``` Export only completed North region orders curl \"http://localhost:8001/ecommerce/orders.csv?status__exact=completed\"Copy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` API access is built-in. Add .json to any URL: curl \"http://localhost:8001/ecommerce/orders.json?_shape=array\"Copy to clipboardErrorCopied Creating Canned Queries Save frequently-run analyses as named queries that appear in the sidebar. Create metadata.json : { \"databases\": { \"ecommerce\": { \"queries\": { \"top_customers\": { \"sql\": \"SELECT c.name, SUM(o.quantity * p.price) as total FROM customers c JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id JOIN products p ON o.product_id = p.product_id WHERE o.status = 'completed' GROUP BY c.customer_id ORDER BY total DESC LIMIT 10\", \"title\": \"Top 10 Customers\" } } } } }Copy to clipboardErrorCopied Launch with metadata: datasette ecommerce.db -m metadata.jsonCopy to clipboardErrorCopied Now “Top 10 Customers” appears in the sidebar, creating a self-service analytics portal.

Below are common cleaning tasks using the DuckDB CLI. Create a Sample Dataset Let’s create a sample dataset that mimics real business data patterns - incomplete customer records, time-series orders, and regional variations. Before working with messy production data, you need a controlled environment to test data cleaning techniques. This sample represents common e-commerce scenarios: missing customer info (20% of orders), seasonal patterns (15-day cycles), and geographic segmentation that drive business decisions like inventory placement and marketing campaigns. duckdb sample.duckdb <<'SQL' CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE orders AS SELECT seq AS order_id, CASE WHEN seq % 5 = 0 THEN NULL ELSE 'Customer ' || seq END AS customer, date '2025-01-01' + CAST(seq % 15 AS INTEGER) AS order_date, CASE WHEN seq % 3 = 0 THEN 'Widget ' || seq ELSE 'Gadget ' || seq END AS product, round(random()*1000, 2) AS amount, CASE WHEN seq % 4 = 0 THEN 'EU' ELSE 'US' END AS region FROM range(1, 50) tbl(seq); SQLCopy to clipboardErrorCopied Create a Messy CSV Let’s also simulate real-world data export issues - unescaped quotes, missing delimiters, and malformed records that break standard CSV parsers. Data rarely arrives clean. Export systems fail, manual data entry introduces errors, and third-party integrations send malformed files. Learning to handle corrupted CSV files prevents hours of debugging and ensures your data pipeline doesn’t break when inevitably receiving bad data from vendors, APIs, or legacy systems. cat <<'EOF' > messy_orders.csv order_id,customer,order_date,product,amount,region 1,Customer 1,2025-01-01,Widget 1,100,US \"2,Customer 2,2025-01-02,Gadget 2,200,US 3,Customer 3,2025-01-03,Gadget 3,300,EU EOFCopy to clipboardErrorCopied Create a Big CSV Next, we’ll create a large dataset to practice memory-efficient processing techniques that handle files too big to fit in RAM. When working with millions of customer records, transaction logs, or sensor data, traditional tools crash or run out of memory. DuckDB’s streaming capabilities let you process 100GB+ files on laptops by reading data in chunks, making big data analysis accessible without expensive infrastructure. duckdb sample.duckdb <<'SQL' COPY (SELECT seq AS id, random() AS val FROM range(100000)) TO 'big.csv'; SQLCopy to clipboardErrorCopied Exploratory Data Analysis We need to examine our data structure and quality before making business decisions. Every data analysis starts with understanding what you have - missing values can skew customer segmentation, outliers affect revenue forecasting, and data types determine which analytical techniques work. Quick EDA prevents costly mistakes like launching marketing campaigns based on incomplete customer data or setting prices using corrupted transaction amounts. -- Preview and get stats SELECT * FROM orders LIMIT 5; DESCRIBE orders; SELECT COUNT(*) AS n, AVG(amount) AS avg_amount FROM orders;Copy to clipboardErrorCopied Converting Data to Other Formats Let’s export cleaned data to formats optimized for different business needs. Analytics teams need Parquet for fast querying, APIs require JSON for web integration, and executives want CSV for Excel compatibility. Format conversion ensures your cleaned data reaches every stakeholder in their preferred format, enabling faster decision-making across departments without forcing everyone to learn SQL. COPY (SELECT * FROM orders) TO 'orders.json' (FORMAT JSON); COPY (SELECT * FROM orders) TO 'orders.parquet' (FORMAT PARQUET);Copy to clipboardErrorCopied Reading Messy CSV We need to handle corrupted files that would normally crash your data pipeline. Real-world CSV files from vendors, legacy systems, or manual exports often contain malformed rows that break standard parsers. Instead of spending hours manually fixing files or losing critical business data, DuckDB’s error handling lets you salvage usable records while identifying problem areas for follow-up with data providers. -- Skip bad lines while loading SELECT * FROM read_csv_auto('messy_orders.csv', ignore_errors=true);Copy to clipboardErrorCopied Handling Missing Values It’s important to address incomplete data that could lead to wrong business conclusions. Missing customer names prevent personalized marketing, absent transaction amounts skew revenue calculations, and incomplete addresses block shipping. Rather than excluding entire records and losing valuable information, strategic imputation preserves data for analysis while clearly marking assumptions made during the cleaning process. -- Replace null customer names SELECT COALESCE(customer, 'Unknown') AS customer FROM orders;Copy to clipboardErrorCopied String Operations It’s common to standardize text data that comes from multiple sources with inconsistent formatting. Product names from different suppliers use varying cases, customer entries have extra spaces, and imported data contains mixed formatting. Clean, consistent strings enable accurate grouping for inventory management, prevent duplicate customer records, and ensure search functionality works properly across your application. SELECT DISTINCT TRIM(LOWER(product)) AS clean_product FROM orders;Copy to clipboardErrorCopied Date Parsing and Conversion Typically, we transform dates into different formats that enable time-based business analysis. Raw date strings from different systems use various formats that prevent proper sorting and filtering. Converting to standard formats enables monthly sales reporting, seasonal trend analysis, and time-based customer segmentation - critical for inventory planning, marketing campaigns, and financial forecasting. SELECT order_id, STRFTIME(order_date, '%Y-%m') AS order_month FROM orders;Copy to clipboardErrorCopied Conditional Logic and Binning A common task is to categorize continuous data into meaningful business segments that drive decision-making. Converting exact dollar amounts into price tiers enables targeted marketing (premium vs budget customers), inventory classification (high/medium/low value items), and commission structures. This segmentation forms the foundation for personalized pricing, customer targeting, and performance analysis. SELECT order_id, CASE WHEN amount > 700 THEN 'high' WHEN amount > 300 THEN 'medium' ELSE 'low' END AS price_band FROM orders;Copy to clipboardErrorCopied Regex Search and Replace We often need to clean complex text patterns that simple string operations can’t handle. Product descriptions contain multiple spaces, phone numbers have inconsistent formatting, and addresses mix abbreviations with full words. Regular expressions fix these patterns systematically, ensuring consistent data quality for customer communications, shipping integrations, and search functionality. SELECT REGEXP_REPLACE(product, '\\\\s+', ' ', 'g') AS tidy_product FROM orders;Copy to clipboardErrorCopied Working with Multiple Formats Let’s combine data from different sources that use various file formats. Modern businesses receive data as CSV exports, JSON from APIs, and Parquet from data warehouses. Rather than maintaining separate processing pipelines, DuckDB’s format flexibility lets you join orders from your CSV exports with customer data from JSON APIs and inventory levels from Parquet files in a single query. CREATE TABLE json_orders AS SELECT * FROM read_json_auto('orders.json'); CREATE TABLE parquet_orders AS SELECT * FROM read_parquet('orders.parquet'); SELECT * FROM orders UNION ALL SELECT * FROM parquet_orders;Copy to clipboardErrorCopied Processing in Chunks We handle massive datasets that exceed available memory by processing them in manageable segments. When analyzing years of transaction logs, customer behavior data, or sensor readings, loading everything at once crashes systems. Chunk processing enables analysis of terabyte-scale datasets on standard hardware, making enterprise-level data analysis accessible for fraud detection, customer lifetime value calculations, and operational analytics. SELECT * FROM read_csv_auto('big.csv') LIMIT 1000 OFFSET 0; SELECT * FROM read_csv_auto('big.csv') LIMIT 1000 OFFSET 1000;Copy to clipboardErrorCopied Filtering Rows and Dropping Columns We’ll focus analysis on relevant data subsets while removing sensitive or unnecessary information. Business analysis rarely needs all data - marketing teams want current customers, finance needs profitable regions, and product managers focus on active items. Efficient filtering reduces processing time, protects sensitive data (removing PII columns), and ensures analysis focuses on business-relevant subsets rather than getting lost in comprehensive but unfocused datasets. SELECT order_id, amount FROM orders WHERE region = 'US'; SELECT * EXCLUDE region FROM orders;Copy to clipboardErrorCopied Derived Columns Now, let’s create new business metrics from existing data that drive key performance indicators. Raw transaction amounts become profit margins with tax calculations, customer regions enable territory-based analysis, and dates support seasonal comparisons. These derived metrics power executive dashboards, sales team performance tracking, and automated business rules without requiring manual calculations or separate reporting tools. SELECT *, amount * 0.1 AS tax, UPPER(region) AS region_code FROM orders;Copy to clipboardErrorCopied Summaries and Pivots A big part of data preparation is to transform detailed transaction data into executive-level insights that inform strategic decisions. Converting thousands of individual orders into regional sales summaries, customer segment performance, and product category trends enables quick identification of growth opportunities, underperforming markets, and inventory optimization needs. These aggregations become the foundation for board presentations, budget planning, and strategic initiatives. ``` -- Aggregation SELECT region, COUNT(*) AS n_orders, SUM(amount) AS total FROM orders GROUP BY region; -- Pivot by region SELECT * FROM orders PIVOT(COUNT(*) FOR region IN ('US', 'EU'));Copy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` Useful links: DuckDB Documentation SQL Functions DuckDB Extensions [Previous Data Preparation in the Editor](#/data-preparation-in-the-editor) [Next Data Transformation with dbt](#/dbt)",

Units are K,M,G,T,P,E,Z,Y (powers of 1024) or KB,MB,... (powers of 1000). Binary prefixes can be used, too: KiB=K, MiB=M, and so on. The TIME_STYLE argument can be full-iso, long-iso, iso, locale, or +FORMAT. FORMAT is interpreted like in date(1). If FORMAT is FORMAT1 FORMAT2, then FORMAT1 applies to non-recent files and FORMAT2 to recent files. TIME_STYLE prefixed with 'posix-' takes effect only outside the POSIX locale. Also the TIME_STYLE environment variable sets the default style to use. Using color to distinguish file types is disabled both by default and with --color=never. With --color=auto, ls emits color codes only when standard output is connected to a terminal. The LS_COLORS environment variable can change the settings. Use the dircolors command to set it. Exit status: 0 if OK, 1 if minor problems (e.g., cannot access subdirectory), 2 if serious trouble (e.g., cannot access command-line argument).

Personally, I believe it’s more likely to be a bot than a French human so interested in my website that they made over 250 requests every day . Find bots But, I’m curious. What are the user agents that DO identify themselves as bots? Let’s use grep to find all words that match bot. grep --only-matching will show only the matches, not the entire line. The regular expression '\\S*bot\\S*' (which ChatGPT generated) finds all words that have bot. \\S matches non-space characters \\S* matches 0 or more non-space characters ``` Find all words with bot in it !grep --only-matching '\\b\\w bot\\w \\b' s-anand.net-Apr-2024 | headCopy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` Applebot applebot Applebot applebot Applebot applebot Applebot applebot Applebot applebotCopy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` Count frequency of all words with bot in it and show the top 10 !grep --only-matching '\\S bot\\S ' s-anand.net-Apr-2024 | sort | uniq --count | sort --key 1n | tailCopy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` 4134 PetalBot;+https://webmaster.petalsearch.com/site/petalbot)\" 4307 /robots.txt 5664 bingbot/2.0; 5664 +http://www.bing.com/bingbot.htm) 8771 +claudebot@anthropic.com)\" 8827 +http://www.google.com/bot.html)\" 8830 Googlebot/2.1; 13798 (Applebot/0.1; 13798 +http://www.apple.com/go/applebot)\" 101262 +https://dataforseo.com/dataforseo-bot)\"Copy to clipboardErrorCopied That gives me a rough sense of who’s crawling my site. DataForSEO Apple Google Anthropic Bing PetalBot Convert logs to CSV This file is almost a CSV file separated by spaces instead of commas. The main problem is the date. Instead of [31/Mar/2024:11:27:43 -0500] it should have been \"31/Mar/2024:11:27:43 -0500\" We’ll use sed (stream editor) to replace the characters. sed is like grep but lets you replace, not just search. (Actually, sed can do a lot more. It’s a full-fledged editor. You can insert, delete, edit, etc. programmatically. In fact, sed has truly remarkable features that this paragraph is too small to contain.) The regular expression we will use is \\[\\([^]]*\\)\\] . The way this works is: \\[ : Match the opening square bracket. \\([^]]*\\) : Capture everything inside the square brackets (non-greedy match for any character except ] ). \\] : Match the closing square bracket. BTW, I didn’t create this. ChatGPT did . sed \"s/abc/xyz/\" FILE replaces abc with xyz in the file. We can use the regular expression above for the search and \"\\1\" for the value – it inserts captured group enclosed in double quotes. ``` Replace [datetime] etc. with \"datetime\" and save as log.csv !sed 's/[([^]]*)]/\"\\1\"/' s-anand.net-Apr-2024 > log.csvCopy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` ``` We should now have a log.csv that's roughly the same size as the original file. !ls -lCopy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` total 101660 -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 52044491 Jun 9 05:19 log.csv drwxr-xr-x 1 root root 4096 Jun 6 14:21 sample_data -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 52044491 Jun 9 05:18 s-anand.net-Apr-2024Copy to clipboardErrorCopied You can download this log.csv and open it in Excel as a CSV file with space as the delimiter. But when I did that, I faced another problem. Some of the lines had extra columns. That’s because the “User Agent” values sometimes contain a quote. CSV files are supposed to escape quotes with \"\" – two double quotes. But Apache uses \\\" instead. I’ll leave it as an exercise for you to fix that. More commands We’ve covered the commands most often used to process data before analysis. Here are a few more that you’ll find useful. cat concatenates multiple files. You can join multiple log files with this, for example awk is almost a full-fledged programming interface. It’s often used for summing up values less lets you open and read files, scrolling through it You can read the book Data Science at the Command Line for more tools and examples.

And that’s where storytelling comes in. What we’re going to look at in this module are ways of telling stories. There are many ways in which you can narrate a story, and one way is just to show the numbers. This in itself can be powerful. What you see here, for example, is a correlation matrix which has conditional formatting on Excel that will help you understand how two securities are correlated. And it’s pretty easy to see that, for example, the Pakistani rupee is negatively correlated with many of the securities. Just the numbers can give people an understanding of what’s happening behind the scenes and convey a story. Another way to narrate the story is through visuals, typically charts. On this chart, for example, you can see that for the last three months, starting from August to September to October, till 31st of October, the number of COVID cases is steadily declining. And the chart itself, the visual itself, tells the story. A third way of narrating a story is through text, where we just use words to communicate what data is telling us. For example, this is a report in plain text, telling Sandra Miles, who is a channel banking manager, how the number of users has performed across different channels, how it’s doing against competition, how it’s doing against the last month’s performance, what its gap is against the target, and so on. In fact, this is perhaps the most common way in which people narrate stories—through text, more than through numbers and through visuals. Yet another way of narrating stories is through illustrations. You’re all familiar with comic books. Comic stories are how most of us started getting into fiction. This too can be applied to data. This visual is a comic story that talks about what went wrong at Tonga, where 90% of the Tongans are obese or overweight. And it takes data and communicates it as a comic story. These mechanisms of storytelling are not mutually exclusive. It’s possible for you to combine all of these into a single story. For example, this story talks about China’s deep pockets. And it uses text clearly in the form of the dialogue between these two characters, as well as the titles. It uses the numbers to indicate what’s happening. It uses a chart, it uses illustrations, it uses comics, and through all of these mechanisms, we get a feel for what’s happening. In this module, what you’ll be learning are tools that will help you create stories from data, using not just numbers and visuals, which have been covered in the earlier modules, but also using text and illustrations. This is a nascent area. This is an area where most technology does not really support you as well as it would for numbers and visuals. But it’s an exciting new field, and I believe that the bulk of communication of data is actually going to be through data storytelling, using text and illustrations as strong support to numbers and visuals.

It’s based on Matplotlib but a bit easier to use, and a bit prettier. This video tutorial provides a comprehensive guide to Seaborn, a powerful data visualization library built on Matplotlib. You’ll learn how to: Understand Seaborn’s core purpose : It’s a data visualization library built on Matplotlib that simplifies plotting, often creating complex plots with just one line of code . Install and set up Seaborn : Learn how to install it using pip or conda , and how to import necessary libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib for seamless integration. Load and manage data : Primarily use Seaborn’s built-in datasets (e.g., car_crashes , tips , flights , iris , attention ) for practice, and understand how to load other file types via Pandas. Create various distribution plots : Distribution plots ( displot ) : Visualize univariate distributions (distributions of a single variable), including histograms and Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) plots, and learn to define bins . Joint plots ( jointplot ) : Compare two distributions by default as a scatter plot , and generate regression lines or show KDE or hexagon distributions . KDE plots ( kdeplot ) : Create standalone plots for kernel density estimations . Pair plots ( pairplot ) : Plot relationships across all numerical values in a DataFrame, showing histograms on the diagonal and scatter plots elsewhere . Rug plots ( rugplot ) : Visualize single column data points as sticks, indicating where data is denser. Master various categorical plots : Bar plots ( barplot ) : Analyze distributions of categorical data against numerical data , understanding variance bars and how to change the aggregation estimator (e.g., median , std , cov ) using NumPy functions. Count plots ( countplot ) : Simply count the number of occurrences for categorical variables. Box plots ( boxplot ) : Compare variables by showing quartiles , median, standard deviation, whiskers, and outliers. Violin plots ( violinplot ) : A combination of box plots and KDE plots , visualizing the density estimation of data points and how to split them for comparison. Strip plots ( stripplot ) : Draw scatter plots with one categorical variable , often used with box plots, and learn to use jitter to spread points and dodge to separate categories. Swarm plots ( swarmplot ) : Similar to strip plots but adjusts points to prevent overlap , often layered on top of violin plots . Generate matrix plots for correlation and data patterns : Heat maps ( heatmap ) : Visualize data in a matrix format , requiring data to be prepared using correlation matrices ( .corr() ) or pivot tables ( .pivot_table() ) , and how to add annotations . Cluster maps ( clustermap ) : Create hierarchically clustered heat maps that calculate distances and reposition data to find specific patterns and clusters . Utilize powerful grid systems for complex visualizations : Pair grids ( PairGrid ) : Gain specific control over plot placement within a grid, allowing you to map different plot types (e.g., scatter, histogram, KDE) to the upper, lower, or diagonal sections. Facet grids ( FacetGrid ) : Print multiple plots in a grid , defining columns and rows based on categorical data, and apply various styling options to individual subplots. Create and customize regression plots : Regression plots ( lmplot ) : Study relationships between numerical variables, customize markers, sizes, and colors, and separate data into columns or rows based on other variables for multi-faceted analysis. Apply extensive styling and customization options : Set overall plot styles ( sns.set_style ) like white , darkgrid , whitegrid , dark , and ticks . Adjust plot size ( plt.figure(figsize=...) ). Change plot context ( sns.set_context ) for different uses: paper (Jupyter), talk (presentation), poster . Control font scale ( font_scale ). Manage axis visibility by turning spines on or off. Change plot color schemes using palettes and exploring Matplotlib’s color maps . Reposition plot legends for better readability. Customize marker symbols , sizes, line widths, and edge colors in various plot types.

    "text": "title: \"Embeddings\" original_url: \"https://tds.s-anand.net/#/embeddings?id=openai-embeddings\" downloaded_at: \"2025-11-17T02:00:42.722536\" Embeddings: OpenAI and Local Models Embedding models convert text into a list of numbers. These are like a map of text in numerical form. Each number represents a feature, and similar texts will have numbers close to each other. So, if the numbers are similar, the text they represent mean something similar. This is useful because text similarity is important in many common problems: Search . Find similar documents to a query. Classification . Classify text into categories. Clustering . Group similar items into clusters. Anomaly Detection . Find an unusual piece of text. You can run embedding models locally or using an API. Local models are better for privacy and cost. APIs are better for scale and quality. | Feature | Local Models | API | | --- | --- | --- | | Privacy | High | Dependent on provider | | Cost | High setup, low after that | Pay-as-you-go | | Scale | Limited by local resources | Easily scales with demand | | Quality | Varies by model | Typically high | The Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) provides comprehensive comparisons of embedding models. These models are compared on several parameters, but here are some key ones to look at: Rank . Higher ranked models have higher quality. Memory Usage . Lower is better (for similar ranks). It costs less and is faster to run. Embedding Dimensions . Lower is better. This is the number of numbers in the array. Smaller dimensions are cheaper to store. Max Tokens . Higher is better. This is the number of input tokens (words) the model can take in a single input. Look for higher scores in the columns for Classification, Clustering, Summarization, etc. based on your needs. Local Embeddings Here’s a minimal example using a local embedding model: ``` /// script requires-python = \"==3.12\" dependencies = [ \"sentence-transformers\", \"httpx\", \"numpy\", ] /// from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer import numpy as np model = SentenceTransformer('BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5') # A small, high quality model async def embed(text: str) -> list[float]: \"\"\"Get embedding vector for text using local model.\"\"\" return model.encode(text).tolist() async def get_similarity(text1: str, text2: str) -> float: \"\"\"Calculate cosine similarity between two texts.\"\"\" emb1 = np.array(await embed(text1)) emb2 = np.array(await embed(text2)) return float(np.dot(emb1, emb2) / (np.linalg.norm(emb1) * np.linalg.norm(emb2))) async def main(): print(await get_similarity(\"Apple\", \"Orange\")) print(await get_similarity(\"Apple\", \"Lightning\")) if name == \" main \": import asyncio asyncio.run(main())Copy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` Note the get_similarity function. It uses a Cosine Similarity to calculate the similarity between two embeddings. OpenAI Embeddings For comparison, here’s how to use OpenAI’s API with direct HTTP calls. Replace the embed function in the earlier script: ``` import os import httpx async def embed(text: str) -> list[float]: \"\"\"Get embedding vector for text using OpenAI's API.\"\"\" async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client: response = await client.post( \"https://api.openai.com/v1/embeddings\", headers={\"Authorization\": f\"Bearer {os.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY']}\"}, json={\"model\": \"text-embedding-3-small\", \"input\": text} ) return response.json()[\"data\"][0][\"embedding\"]Copy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` NOTE : You need to set the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable for this to work.

Gemini transcription The Gemini models from Google are notable in two ways: They have a huge input context window. Gemini 2.0 Flash can accept 1M tokens, for example. They can handle audio input. This allows us to use Gemini to transcribe audio files. LLMs are not good at transcribing audio faithfully . They tend to correct errors and meander from what was said. But they are intelligent. That enables a few powerful workflows. Here are some examples: Transcribe into other languages . Gemini will handle the transcription and translation in a single step. Summarize audio transcripts . For example, convert a podcast into a tutorial, or a meeting recording into actions. Legal Proceeding Analysis . Extract case citations, dates, and other details from a legal debate. Medical Consultation Summary . Extract treatments, medications, details of next visit, etc. from a medical consultation. Here’s how to use Gemini to transcribe audio files. Get a Gemini API key from Google AI Studio. Set the GEMINI_API_KEY environment variable to the API key. Set the MP3_FILE environment variable to the path of the MP3 file you want to transcribe. Run this code: curl -X POST https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-1.5-flash-002:streamGenerateContent?alt=sse \\ -H \"X-Goog-API-Key: $GEMINI_API_KEY\" \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -d \"$(cat << EOF { \"contents\": [ { \"role\": \"user\", \"parts\": [ { \"inline_data\": { \"mime_type\": \"audio/mp3\", \"data\": \"$(base64 --wrap=0 $MP3_FILE)\" } }, {\"text\": \"Transcribe this\"} ] } ] } EOF )\"Copy to clipboardErrorCopied [Previous Transforming Images](#/transforming-images) [Next Data Analysis](#/data-analysis)",

This is perfect for building chatbots and AI assistants that need to interact with your backend systems. OpenAI supports Function Calling – a way for LLMs to suggest what functions to call and how. Here’s a minimal example using Python and OpenAI’s function calling that identifies the weather in a given location. ``` /// script requires-python = \">=3.11\" dependencies = [ \"httpx\", ] /// import httpx import os from typing import Dict, Any def query_gpt(user_input: str, tools: list[Dict[str, Any]]) -> Dict[str, Any]: response = httpx.post( \"https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions\", headers={ \"Authorization\": f\"Bearer {os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY')}\", \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\", }, json={ \"model\": \"gpt-4o-mini\", \"messages\": [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": user_input}], \"tools\": tools, \"tool_choice\": \"auto\", }, ) return response.json()[\"choices\"][0][\"message\"] WEATHER_TOOL = { \"type\": \"function\", \"function\": { \"name\": \"get_weather\", \"description\": \"Get the current weather for a location\", \"parameters\": { \"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": { \"location\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"City name or coordinates\"} }, \"required\": [\"location\"], \"additionalProperties\": False, }, \"strict\": True, }, } if name == \" main \": response = query_gpt(\"What is the weather in San Francisco?\", [WEATHER_TOOL]) print([tool_call[\"function\"] for tool_call in response[\"tool_calls\"]])Copy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` How to define functions The function definition is a JSON schema with a few OpenAI specific properties. See the Supported schemas . Here’s an example of a function definition for scheduling a meeting: MEETING_TOOL = { \"type\": \"function\", \"function\": { \"name\": \"schedule_meeting\", \"description\": \"Schedule a meeting room for a specific date and time\", \"parameters\": { \"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": { \"date\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"Meeting date in YYYY-MM-DD format\" }, \"time\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"Meeting time in HH:MM format\" }, \"meeting_room\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"Name of the meeting room\" } }, \"required\": [\"date\", \"time\", \"meeting_room\"], \"additionalProperties\": False }, \"strict\": True } }Copy to clipboardErrorCopied How to define multiple functions You can define multiple functions by passing a list of function definitions to the tools parameter. Here’s an example of a list of function definitions for handling employee expenses and calculating performance bonuses: tools = [ { \"type\": \"function\", \"function\": { \"name\": \"get_expense_balance\", \"description\": \"Get expense balance for an employee\", \"parameters\": { \"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": { \"employee_id\": { \"type\": \"integer\", \"description\": \"Employee ID number\" } }, \"required\": [\"employee_id\"], \"additionalProperties\": False }, \"strict\": True } }, { \"type\": \"function\", \"function\": { \"name\": \"calculate_performance_bonus\", \"description\": \"Calculate yearly performance bonus for an employee\", \"parameters\": { \"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": { \"employee_id\": { \"type\": \"integer\", \"description\": \"Employee ID number\" }, \"current_year\": { \"type\": \"integer\", \"description\": \"Year to calculate bonus for\" } }, \"required\": [\"employee_id\", \"current_year\"], \"additionalProperties\": False }, \"strict\": True } } ]Copy to clipboardErrorCopied Best Practices: Use Strict Mode Always set strict: True to ensure valid function calls Define all required parameters Set additionalProperties: False Use tool choice Set tool_choice: \"required\" to ensure that the model will always call one or more tools The default is tool_choice: \"auto\" which means the model will choose a tool only if appropriate Clear Descriptions Write detailed function and parameter descriptions Include expected formats and units Mention any constraints or limitations Error Handling Validate function inputs before execution Return clear error messages Handle missing or invalid parameters [Previous LLM Speech](#/llm-speech) [Next LLM Agents](#/llm-agents)",

    "text": "title: \"HuggingFace Spaces\" original_url: \"https://tds.s-anand.net/#/huggingface-spaces?id=setting-up-a-docker-space\" downloaded_at: \"2025-11-17T01:48:26.599343\" Container hosting: Hugging Face Spaces with Docker Container platforms let you deploy applications in isolated, portable environments that include all dependencies. They’re perfect for ML applications that need custom environments, specific packages, or persistent state . Here are some common real-life uses: A text summarization API that processes documents using custom NLP models (runs for 10-30 seconds per request) An image classification tool that requires specific computer vision libraries (runs for 5-15 seconds per upload) A chatbot with custom fine-tuned models that need GPU acceleration (runs for 2-5 seconds per message) Unlike serverless functions, containers can maintain state, install any packages, write to the filesystem, and run background processes. They provide more control over the environment but require more configuration. Hugging Face Spaces hosts ML apps with free CPU runtime for public repos and paid upgrades for persistent runs or stronger hardware. It plugs into the wider Hub—models, datasets, and tokens—so you can ship demos quickly. Spaces offer four SDKs when you create a project: Gradio (default ML demos), Streamlit (dashboards), Static HTML , and Docker for any custom stack. This guide focuses on Docker Spaces , which provide full control over runtimes and dependencies. Setting up a Docker Space Sign up with Hugging Face and create a new Space. Choose “Docker” as your SDK. Your Space repository needs these essential files: README.md - Configure your Space with YAML frontmatter : ``` title: My FastAPI App emoji: 🚀 colorFrom: blue colorTo: green sdk: docker app_port: 7860 My FastAPI Application Description of your app goes here.Copy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` Dockerfile - Define your container environment (see Dockerfile documentation ): ``` FROM python:3.11-slim Create the same UID (1000) that Spaces uses when running your container RUN useradd -m -u 1000 user Install Python dependencies before copying the entire source tree WORKDIR /home/user/app COPY --chown=user requirements.txt . RUN pip install --no-cache-dir --upgrade pip && \\ pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt Copy the rest of the app and switch to the non-root user COPY --chown=user . . USER user ENV HOME=/home/user PATH=/home/user/.local/bin:$PATH EXPOSE 7860 CMD [\"uvicorn\", \"main:app\", \"--host\", \"0.0.0.0\", \"--port\", \"7860\"]Copy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` Spaces execute your container as UID 1000. Creating that user in the image avoids permission problems when the platform switches users at runtime. requirements.txt - List your Python dependencies: fastapi uvicorn[standard] transformers torchCopy to clipboardErrorCopied main.py - Your FastAPI application: ``` from fastapi import FastAPI from transformers import pipeline app = FastAPI() Initialize your model (this happens once when container starts) classifier = pipeline(\"sentiment-analysis\") @app.get(\"/\") def read_root(): return {\"message\": \"Hello from Hugging Face Spaces!\"} @app.post(\"/analyze\") def analyze_sentiment(text: str): result = classifier(text) return {\"sentiment\": result[0][\"label\"], \"score\": result[0][\"score\"]}Copy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` Deployment Process Create Space : Visit huggingface.co/new-space and select Docker SDK. Clone Repository : git clone https://huggingface.co/spaces/your-username/your-space-name Add Files : Create the files above in your local repository. Deploy : git add . git commit -m \"Initial deployment\" git pushCopy to clipboardErrorCopied Your Space will automatically build and deploy. Build time depends on your base image and dependency downloads—refresh the Logs tab if the build appears stuck. Writing Files and Data Persistence Docker Spaces support both temporary and persistent storage. Every Space gets 50 GB of free ephemeral disk that resets whenever the Space restarts or is paused. Temporary Files (reset on restart): ``` import tempfile import os Write temporary files with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(mode='w', delete=False) as f: f.write(\"This will be lost on restart\") temp_path = f.name Read it back with open(temp_path, 'r') as f: content = f.read()Copy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` Persistent Files (paid upgrade): Upgrade to a persistent storage plan from the Space Settings tab to mount /data as durable disk. Tiers start at 20 GB for $5/month and scale up to 1 TB for $100/month. The /data volume exists only at runtime (not during Docker build). ``` import os Write to persistent storage (requires upgrade) data_dir = \"/data\" if os.path.exists(data_dir): with open(f\"{data_dir}/persistent_file.txt\", \"w\") as f: f.write(\"This persists across restarts\")Copy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` Using Hugging Face Hub for Data Storage (Free Alternative): As a free alternative to persistent storage, you can programmatically upload files to a Hugging Face Dataset repository using the huggingface_hub library . ``` from huggingface_hub import HfApi, upload_file Upload files to a dataset repository for persistence api = HfApi() upload_file( path_or_fileobj=\"local_file.json\", path_in_repo=\"data/saved_data.json\", repo_id=\"your-username/your-dataset\", repo_type=\"dataset\" )Copy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` Environment Variables and Secrets Adding Variables : Go to your Space settings → Variables & secrets tab. Add environment variables and secrets that will be available in your container. Using Variables in Code : ``` import os Access environment variables model_name = os.environ.get(\"MODEL_NAME\", \"default-model\") api_key = os.environ.get(\"SECRET_API_KEY\") # For secretsCopy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` Using Variables in Dockerfile : You can expose variables at build time using the ARG directive. ``` Declare build-time variables ARG MODEL_REPO_NAME ENV MODEL_NAME=$MODEL_REPO_NAME Use in your application RUN echo \"Using model: $MODEL_NAME\"Copy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` Advanced Features Hardware upgrades : By default Spaces run on the free CPU basic tier (2 vCPU, 16 GB RAM, 50 GB disk). You can switch to CPU Upgrade ($0.03/hour) or attach GPUs/TPUs such as T4, A10G, L40S, H100, and TPU v5e in the Settings → Hardware panel. See the hardware spec table for prices and memory footprints. GPU Support : When you select GPU hardware, base your image on an NVIDIA CUDA runtime and install CUDA-ready wheels. GPU devices are injected only at runtime—skip commands like nvidia-smi during the Docker build phase. FROM nvidia/cuda:12.1.1-runtime-ubuntu22.04Copy to clipboardErrorCopied Multiple Ports : Spaces expose a single public port. To serve multiple internal services, run a reverse proxy (for example Nginx or Caddy) and route everything through the exposed port defined by app_port . RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y nginx && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/* COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/nginx.confCopy to clipboardErrorCopied Custom Dependencies : Install system packages before switching away from root to avoid permission issues. RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \\ build-essential \\ curl \\ software-properties-common \\ && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*Copy to clipboardErrorCopied Keep persistent caches (like Hugging Face model downloads) under /data/.huggingface after enabling persistent storage and setting HF_HOME=/data/.huggingface so restarts skip re-downloading assets.

By mixing exact text matches with embedding-based similarity, you get the best of both worlds: precision when keywords are present, and semantic recall when phrasing varies. TypeSense makes this easy with built-in hybrid search and automatic embedding generation. Below is a fully self-contained Hybrid RAG tutorial using TypeSense, Python, and the command line. Install and run TypeSense Install TypeSense . ``` mkdir typesense-data docker run -p 8108:8108 \\ -v typesense-data:/data typesense/typesense:28.0 \\ --data-dir /data \\ --api-key=secret-key \\ --enable-corsCopy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` docker run : spins up a containerized TypeSense server on port 8108 -p 8108:8108 maps host port to container port. -v typesense-data:/data mounts a Docker volume for persistence. --data-dir /data points TypeSense at that volume. --api-key=secret-key secures your API. --enable-cors allows browser-based requests. Expected output: Docker logs showing TypeSense startup messages, such as Started Typesense API server . Listening on http://0.0.0.0:8108 . Embed and import documents into TypeSense Follow the steps in the RAG with the CLI tutorial to create a chunks.json that has one {id, content} JSON object per line. TypeSense supports automatic embedding of documents . We’ll use that capability. Save the following as addnotes.py and run it with uv run addnotes.py . ``` /// script requires-python = \">=3.13\" dependencies = [\"httpx\"] /// import json import httpx import os headers = {\"X-TYPESENSE-API-KEY\": \"secret-key\"} schema = { \"name\": \"notes\", \"fields\": [ {\"name\": \"id\", \"type\": \"string\", \"facet\": False}, {\"name\": \"content\", \"type\": \"string\", \"facet\": False}, { \"name\": \"embedding\", \"type\": \"float[]\", \"embed\": { \"from\": [\"content\"], \"model_config\": { \"model_name\": \"openai/text-embedding-3-small\", \"api_key\": os.getenv(\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"), }, }, }, ], } with open(\"chunks.json\", \"r\") as f: chunks = [json.loads(line) for line in f.readlines()] with httpx.Client() as client: # Create the collection if client.get(f\"http://localhost:8108/collections/notes\", headers=headers).status_code == 404: r = client.post(\"http://localhost:8108/collections\", json=schema, headers=headers) # Embed the chunks result = client.post( \"http://localhost:8108/collections/notes/documents/import?action=emplace\", headers={**headers, \"Content-Type\": \"text/plain\"}, data=\"\\n\".join(json.dumps(chunk) for chunk in chunks), ) print(result.text)Copy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` httpx.Client : an HTTP client for Python. Collection schema : id and content fields plus an embedding field with auto-generated embeddings from OpenAI. Auto-embedding : the embed block instructs TypeSense to call the specified model for each document. GET /collections/notes : checks existence. POST /collections : creates the collection. POST /collections/notes/documents/import?action=emplace : bulk upsert documents, embedding them on the fly. Expected output: A JSON summary string like {\"success\": X, \"failed\": 0} indicating how many docs were imported. (On timeouts, re-run until all chunks are processed.) 4. Run a hybrid search and answer a question Now, we can use a single curl against the Multi-Search endpoint to combine keyword and vector search as a hybrid search : ``` Q=\"What does the author affectionately call the => syntax?\" payload=$(jq -n --arg coll \"notes\" --arg q \"$Q\" \\ '{ searches: [ { collection: $coll, q: $q, query_by: \"content,embedding\", sort_by: \"_text_match:desc\", prefix: false, exclude_fields: \"embedding\" } ] }' ) curl -s 'http://localhost:8108/multi_search' \\ -H \"X-TYPESENSE-API-KEY: secret-key\" \\ -d \"$payload\" \\ | jq -r '.results[].hits[].document.content' \\ | llm -s \"${Q} - \\$Answer ONLY from these notes. Cite verbatim from the notes.\" \\ | uvx streamdownCopy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` query_by: \"content,embedding\" : tells TypeSense to score by both keyword and vector similarity. sort_by: \"_text_match:desc\" : boosts exact text hits. exclude_fields: \"embedding\" : keeps responses lightweight. curl -d : posts the search request. jq -r : extracts each hit’s content . See jq manual llm -s and uvx streamdown : generate and stream a grounded answer. Expected output: The raw matched snippets printed first. Then a concise, streamed LLM answer citing the note verbatim.

Often, pages have dozens of images. Image analysis runs over thousands of images. The cost of storage and bandwidth can grow over time. Here are things you should know when you’re compressing images: Image dimensions are the width and height of the image in pixels. This impacts image size a lot Lossless compression (PNG, WebP) preserves exact data Lossy compression (JPEG, WebP) removes some data for smaller files Vector formats (SVG) scale without quality loss WebP is the modern standard, supporting both lossy and lossless Here’s a rule of thumb you can use as of 2025. Use SVG if you can (i.e. if it’s vector graphics or you can convert it to one) Else, reduce the image to as small as you can, and save as (lossy or lossless) WebP Common operations with Python: ``` from pathlib import Path from PIL import Image def compress_image(input_path: Path, output_path: Path, quality: int = 85) -> None: \"\"\"Compress an image while maintaining reasonable quality.\"\"\" with Image.open(input_path) as img: if img.mode == 'RGBA': img = img.convert('RGB') img.save(output_path, 'WEBP', quality=quality, optimize=True) Batch process images for p in Path('images').glob('*.jpg'): compress_image(p, p.with_suffix('.webp'))Copy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` Command line tools include cwebp , pngquant , jpegoptim , and ImageMagick . ``` Convert to WebP cwebp -q 85 input.png -o output.webp Optimize PNG pngquant --quality=65-80 image.png Optimize JPEG jpegoptim --strip-all --all-progressive --max=85 image.jpg Convert and resize convert input.jpg -resize 800x600 output.jpg Batch convert mogrify -format webp -quality 85 *.jpgCopy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` Watch this video on modern image formats and optimization (15 min): Tools for image optimization: squoosh.app : Browser-based compression ImageOptim : GUI tool for Mac sharp : Node.js image processing Pillow : Python imaging library [Previous Local LLMs: Ollama](#/ollama) [Next REST APIs](#/rest-apis)",

Is my audio audible, and can I share my screen if needed? A1: Yes, I can hear you, though there might be some audio issues on both our ends. For now, let’s proceed with the session. Q2: Can you give me an overview of today’s project agenda? A2: Today, we’ll focus on creating a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system. This involves converting data into Markdown, processing images into text descriptions using LLMs, performing chunking, storing embeddings efficiently, and finally, deploying and testing the application. Q3: Where does the data for this project come from? A3: We’re using the Tools in Data Science (TDS) guide content, which includes 12 weeks of material and images. You can get this data directly from the public GitHub repository. Q4: When extracting data using the API, should I create one JSON file per thread (topic)? A4: Yes, your understanding is correct. You should create one JSON file for each thread or topic. Q5: My scraped data contains mixed content (text, image URLs, etc.). Should I separate these, or is it okay to keep them mixed when creating JSON files? A5: While it’s okay to have mixed content initially, the best approach for performance and accuracy is to convert all data (text, URLs, etc.) into a clean Markdown format. Then, specifically for images, you should extract them and replace their URLs with an LLM-generated text description within the Markdown file. Q6: When dealing with images, I shouldn’t directly embed them, but rather ask an LLM to describe the image and then embed that description. Is that right? A6: Absolutely, that’s correct and a crucial “hot tip” we haven’t shared elsewhere. Directly embedding images is inefficient and costly. Instead, use an LLM to generate a detailed text description of the image, and then embed that description . This significantly improves accuracy and reduces embedding costs. Q7: When you say “ask the LLM to read the image,” do you mean using OCR, or is it a different process? A7: No, not OCR. We’re asking the LLM to describe the image carefully. This requires careful prompt engineering to get a high-quality, meaningful description. Test your prompts independently to ensure they accurately describe the images. Q8: What specific Python libraries or tools are you using in the demo for processing HTML and images? A8: We’re using html2text for converting HTML to Markdown, BeautifulSoup for parsing HTML documents and locating elements, and the Gemini API for generating image descriptions. numpy.savez is used for storing embeddings. Q9: How do I get and use the Gemini API key, and is it free? A9: You can obtain your Gemini API key from AI Studio. It’s free, but comes with rate limits: 500 requests per day and 10 requests per minute for the Flash 2.0 model, which is what we’re using. If you pay, you get more. Q10: How do you handle API rate limiting when making many calls to Gemini, especially when generating embeddings at high speed? A10: We implement an exponential backoff strategy using a RateLimiter function. If a 429 “Too Many Requests” error occurs, it waits for 1 second on the first retry, 4 seconds on the second, and 8 seconds on the third. We allow a maximum of three retries before stopping. Q11: Why is chunking necessary, and what’s the best strategy for it? A11: Chunking is crucial because LLMs have token limits for embeddings. You can’t embed an entire document at once. There’s no single “best” strategy; it’s an “art” that requires experimentation. A good approach is to have slight overlaps between chunks (e.g., include a sentence or two from the previous chunk in the next one) to maintain context. You’ll need to empirically test different chunking strategies to find what works best for your project. Q12: How are the generated embeddings stored? A12: We store all embeddings in a compressed NumPy array archive ( .npz file) using numpy.savez . This keeps the file size small (e.g., 15MB for the entire project) and is very efficient for our use case. Q13: How will we access these stored embeddings for retrieval? A13: We will retrieve the embeddings from the NumPy archive. When a user sends a query, we’ll convert that query into an embedding, then use cosine similarity to find the most relevant embeddings (e.g., top 5 or 10) from our stored archive. These relevant embeddings, along with their associated content, will form the context for the LLM’s response. Q14: What are the recommended options for deploying our application? A14: We’ll demonstrate three deployment methods: Vercel: Always-on, but requires a serverless function setup which can be slightly complex. Render: Easy setup, similar to local development, but servers go inactive after a few minutes, leading to a slow first response. Hugging Face: High-performance and free, using Docker containers. It’s a bit more complex to set up due to Dockerization, but very powerful and popular for LLM applications. Q15: What are the requirements for the final application, and how will it be tested? A15: Your application should be accessible worldwide via a URL endpoint (which you’ll provide to us). We’ll test it using PromptFoo with a set of 10 questions. Each question has two assertion types: an LLM rubric test (checking contextual correctness) and a “contains” test (checking for exact text matches). Your application needs to respond within 30 seconds per question. Q16: What tools should I use for testing, and how should I create test cases? A16: We’ll be using PromptFoo for testing. You can refer to the “LLM Evals” video in the Tools in Data Science course (Week 3) for guidance. Create your own test cases with relevant questions and expected assertions. We strongly recommend watching that video to understand how to build robust test cases. Q17: How can I access the necessary Python files ( .py ) for the demo and the Markdown files from the repository? A17: You can use git clone with the GitHub CLI to clone the entire repository. This will recreate the folder structure on your local machine. Once cloned, you can use Python’s os.walk to iterate through the directories and access the Markdown and other .py files. Q18: I’m not from a coding background, and I’m worried about completing this project. Is it truly possible, and what should I focus on? A18: Yes, it is absolutely possible! We’ve designed these sessions to provide all the knowledge and tools you need. Focus on understanding the core concepts – data acquisition, chunking, embedding, and application deployment. These sessions string together the individual components you’ve learned. You have all the ingredients; just apply them. Your non-coding background is not a barrier; it’s an opportunity to learn a valuable skill. We’re confident you can do it. Q19: What’s the bonus question about, regarding the final submission? A19: The bonus question is for a script that scrapes Discourse posts, not just uses the API. If your GitHub repository includes a script that successfully scrapes Discourse posts (rather than just fetching JSON via API), you can earn a bonus mark. Q20: When will the recordings of these sessions be available? A20: The availability of recordings depends on Google’s processing time. For example, yesterday’s recording was available around 3 AM. We then do our own processing and upload it. So, recordings are typically available the morning after the session. Q21: How will you test my deployed application? A21: We’ll use our own API keys for testing. You need to provide us with the URL endpoint for your deployed application. We will then send PromptFoo tests (using NPX promptfoo run -f <YAML_FILE> -u <YOUR_APP_URL> ) to your application’s endpoint. We will be using our own YAML test files, not yours. Q22: I’m worried about the project deadline. Is it possible to get an extension until November 20th? A22: At the moment, we cannot make any promises regarding an extension. The assumption is that by the end of day 14 (November 14th), most students, especially if they have watched all three sessions, should be able to complete the project. We still feel it’s doable within the current timeframe, and we expect you to have all the necessary knowledge and tools. However, we understand challenges can arise, and we appreciate your dedication. Q23: I’m facing a hard deadline for the project. Is it really possible to finish in two days, especially since I’m lagging on LLMs? A23: Yes, it is absolutely doable. We expect you to have already done the data scraping from yesterday’s session. Today, we showed you how to chunk and embed that data. Tomorrow, we will create the application itself. If you follow tomorrow’s session, you will be able to complete the project. Your focus should be on getting the data, chunking, and embedding it. The rest is application development, which we’ll cover tomorrow. Q24: For the testing on PromptFoo, can I just show you my test setup directly from my system? A24: No, your application needs to be accessible worldwide. You will provide us with the URL endpoint of your deployed application (accessible over the internet), and we will run our tests against that URL. We won’t test directly on your local system. Q25: I’m just getting a little stressed about how to complete this project in two days. How can I manage? A25: I understand it can feel stressful, but remember these sessions are designed to guide you. Try to absorb what we’ve covered today, and you’ll have something ready for tomorrow. You’ll have time to ask questions, and we’ll show you the application development. It’s a marathon, not a sprint. We’re here to help. Q26: What’s the best way to get all the required project files from the GitHub repository? A26: The most efficient way is to use git clone with the GitHub CLI. This command ( git clone <repo_url> ) will replicate the entire repository structure, including all files and subdirectories, directly to your local machine. Q27: Can I use any platform for deployment, like Railway, or do I have to stick to the ones you mentioned? A27: You can use any platform you prefer (Railway, Vercel, Render, Hugging Face, or even your own on-premise server) as long as your application is accessible worldwide via a URL endpoint. However, if you use a platform not explicitly covered, make sure to include all necessary configuration files (like vercel.json or Railway’s configuration) in your GitHub repository, so we can replicate your deployment setup if needed. We need to be able to access and test your application without issues. Q28: Is it better to test my deployed application locally, or should I involve others? A28: It’s crucial to test your application from outside your local network. Don’t just test it locally. Ask a friend (even someone in a different city or country) to test it using the PromptFoo command you provide. This ensures your application is truly accessible globally and performs as expected from different locations. Q29: When testing, you mentioned using a YML file. What does that file contain, and do I need to create it? A29: The YML file contains the test cases that PromptFoo will run against your application. It specifies the questions, expected responses, and the type of assertions (e.g., LLM rubric, ‘contains’) for each test. We will provide our own YML test files for evaluation, so you don’t need to create them. Q30: I’m confused about the URL in the YML file. Do I need to put my local host URL, or a deployed one? A30: You need to put the URL of your deployed application in the YML file, not your local host. This is the URL that makes your application accessible worldwide. We will use this URL to send our test requests. Q31: For the test",

Unlike simple prompt-response patterns, agents make multiple LLM calls, use tools, and adapt their approach based on intermediate results. They represent a significant step toward more autonomous AI systems. What Makes an Agent? An LLM agent consists of three core components: LLM Brain : Makes decisions about what to do next Tools : External capabilities the agent can use (e.g., web search, code execution) Memory : Retains context across multiple steps Agents operate through a loop: Observe the environment Think about what to do Take action using tools Observe results Repeat until task completion Command-Line Agent Example We’ve created a minimal command-line agent called llm-cmd-agent.py that: Takes a task description from the command line Generates code to accomplish the task Automatically extracts and executes the code Passes the results back to the LLM Provides a final answer or tries again if the execution fails Here’s how it works: uv run llm-cmd-agent.py \"list all Python files under the current directory, recursively, by size\" uv run llm-cmd-agent.py \"convert the largest Markdown file to HTML\"Copy to clipboardErrorCopied The agent will: Generate a shell script to list files with their sizes Execute the script in a subprocess Capture the output (stdout and stderr) Pass the output back to the LLM for interpretation Present a final answer to the user Under the hood, the agent follows this workflow: Initial prompt to generate a shell script Code extraction from the LLM response Code execution in a subprocess Result interpretation by the LLM Error handling and retry logic if needed This demonstrates the core agent loop of: Planning (generating code) Execution (running the code) Reflection (interpreting results) Adaptation (fixing errors if needed) Agent Architectures Different agent architectures exist for different use cases: ReAct (Reasoning + Acting): Interleaves reasoning steps with actions Reflexion : Adds self-reflection to improve reasoning MRKL (Modular Reasoning, Knowledge and Language): Combines neural and symbolic modules Plan-and-Execute : Creates a plan first, then executes steps Real-World Applications LLM agents can be applied to various domains: Research assistants that search, summarize, and synthesize information Coding assistants that write, debug, and explain code Data analysis agents that clean, visualize, and interpret data Customer service agents that handle queries and perform actions Personal assistants that manage schedules, emails, and tasks Project Ideas Here are some practical agent projects you could build: Study buddy agent : Helps create flashcards, generates practice questions, and explains concepts Job application assistant : Searches job listings, tailors resumes, and prepares interview responses Personal finance agent : Categorizes expenses, suggests budgets, and identifies savings opportunities Health and fitness coach : Creates workout plans, tracks nutrition, and provides motivation Course project helper : Breaks down assignments, suggests resources, and reviews work Best Practices Clear instructions : Define the agent’s capabilities and limitations Effective tool design : Create tools that are specific and reliable Robust error handling : Agents should recover gracefully from failures Memory management : Balance context retention with token efficiency User feedback : Allow users to correct or guide the agent Limitations and Challenges Current LLM agents face several challenges: Hallucination : Agents may generate false information or tool calls Planning limitations : Complex tasks require better planning capabilities Tool integration complexity : Each new tool adds implementation overhead Context window constraints : Limited memory for long-running tasks Security concerns : Tool access requires careful permission management [Previous Function Calling](#/function-calling) [Next Pydantic AI](#/pydantic-ai)",

Instead of writing explicit code to navigate DOM structures and CSS selectors, you describe what data you want and let the LLM figure out how to extract it. This approach works for both simple public pages and complex scenarios requiring authentication, JavaScript rendering, and dynamic interactions. LLMs can write scraping code, control browsers, adapt to layout changes, and even handle captchas through browser automation. Watch these demonstrations of LLM-powered scraping: In this module, you’ll learn: Chrome Remote Debugging : Control browsers programmatically for authenticated scraping Agentic scraping : Let LLMs write and execute scraping code autonomously Vibe scraping workflow : Describe desired data instead of writing selectors Handling dynamic content : Login walls, JavaScript rendering, hover elements Multi-strategy approaches : HTML, APIs, browser automation, and hybrid methods Why LLMs for web scraping? Traditional web scraping is brittle and time-consuming: Selectors break when websites change layout Authentication requires complex session management Dynamic content needs headless browsers and wait strategies Maintenance consumes developer time as sites evolve LLMs solve these problems by: Adapting to changes : Describe data semantically, not structurally Handling complexity : Write browser automation code on the fly Multiple strategies : Try HTML parsing, then APIs, then browser control Self-healing : Debug and fix scraping errors autonomously Key insight : Don’t write scraping code—describe the data you want and let the LLM choose the best extraction strategy. Vibe scraping workflow The core principle: outcomes over implementation . Traditional scraping ``` You write this explicitly from bs4 import BeautifulSoup import requests response = requests.get(\"https://example.com/products\") soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser') products = soup.find_all('div', class_='product-card') data = [] for product in products: title = product.find('h2', class_='title').text price = product.find('span', class_='price').text data.append({'title': title, 'price': price})Copy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` Vibe scraping Search for \"AI website traffic\" and scrape the content. Convert into usable data that I can visualize.Copy to clipboardErrorCopied The LLM decides: Whether to use requests + BeautifulSoup, Playwright, or Chrome debugging Which selectors to target How to structure output (CSV, JSON, database) Error handling and retries Chrome Remote Debugging setup Chrome Remote Debugging allows programmatic control of Chrome, enabling authenticated scraping without explicit credential handling. Step 1: Launch Chrome in debug mode Windows: \"C:\\Program Files\\Google\\Chrome\\Application\\chrome.exe\" --remote-debugging-port=9222 --user-data-dir=\"C:\\chrome-debug-profile\"Copy to clipboardErrorCopied Mac: /Applications/Google\\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\\ Chrome --remote-debugging-port=9222 --user-data-dir=\"/tmp/chrome-debug-profile\"Copy to clipboardErrorCopied Linux: google-chrome --remote-debugging-port=9222 --user-data-dir=\"/tmp/chrome-debug-profile\"Copy to clipboardErrorCopied This opens a new Chrome window with remote control enabled. Step 2: Verify debugging works Open http://localhost:9222 in the debug Chrome window. You should see a JSON list of open tabs. Step 3: Give context to your coding agent In Codex , Claude Code , or Cursor , provide this context: ``` I have Chrome remote debugging running on localhost:9222. The browser is already logged into [website name]. [Your scraping task here]Copy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` The agent will: Connect to Chrome via the Chrome DevTools Protocol Navigate to pages Extract data Handle JavaScript rendering automatically Authenticated website scraping One of the most powerful LLM scraping use cases: extracting data from sites behind login walls. Example: LinkedIn invites analysis ``` I have Chrome remote debugging running on localhost:9222. The browser is already logged into LinkedIn. Go to my LinkedIn invites page. Of the 30 most recent invites, how many people are from the IT industry vs outside it? Save the details in invites.md with: - Name - Title - Company - Industry classificationCopy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` The LLM will: Navigate to the invites page Identify invite cards in the DOM Extract text content Classify industries (using its world knowledge) Structure data and save to markdown Result : In ~2 minutes, you get analysis that would take 30+ minutes manually. Example: Salesforce data extraction ``` I have Chrome remote debugging running on localhost:9222. The browser is logged into Salesforce. Navigate to [specific Salesforce URL]. Extract all data for profile ID: [ID]. Include any hover-over tooltips or hidden content. Save as salesforce_data.json.Copy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` The LLM can: Trigger hovers to reveal tooltips Wait for lazy-loaded content Handle dynamic JavaScript rendering Export structured JSON Security considerations Pros: No credential storage in code Browser maintains session state Full control over what’s accessed Can review actions in real-time Cons: Agent can access anything you’re logged into Potential for unintended actions May violate site terms of service Best practices: Use dedicated Chrome profiles for scraping (don’t mix with personal browsing) Review prompts carefully before execution in sensitive environments Start with read-only operations before allowing writes Check site terms of service —some sites explicitly ban automated access Prefer official APIs when available to avoid account bans Handling dynamic content Modern websites use JavaScript heavily. LLMs can handle this through browser automation. Scenario 1: Hover-triggered content On this page, some data appears only when hovering over elements. Scrape all visible data AND all hover-revealed content.Copy to clipboardErrorCopied The LLM will: Identify hoverable elements Trigger hover events via JavaScript Wait for content to appear Extract revealed data Scenario 2: Infinite scroll This page uses infinite scroll. Scrape all items, not just the initially visible ones. Keep scrolling until no new items appear.Copy to clipboardErrorCopied The LLM generates code like: ``` previous_height = 0 while True: # Scroll to bottom driver.execute_script(\"window.scrollTo(0, document.body.scrollHeight)\") time.sleep(2) # Wait for load new_height = driver.execute_script(\"return document.body.scrollHeight\") if new_height == previous_height: break previous_height = new_height Now extract all itemsCopy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` Scenario 3: Lazy-loaded images This page lazy-loads images as you scroll. Scrape all product images, ensuring they're fully loaded before extraction.Copy to clipboardErrorCopied The LLM handles: Scrolling to trigger lazy load Waiting for src attributes to populate Distinguishing placeholder vs actual images Multi-strategy scraping LLMs excel at trying multiple approaches when one fails. Strategy 1: HTML parsing (fastest) ``` import requests from bs4 import BeautifulSoup response = requests.get(url) soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')Copy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` Pros : Fast, no browser overhead Cons : Fails with JavaScript-rendered content Strategy 2: API discovery (most reliable) LLMs can analyze Network tab requests and find hidden APIs: Open DevTools Network tab and navigate the site. Find the API endpoint that loads this data. Use that API directly instead of scraping HTML.Copy to clipboardErrorCopied Pros : Stable, structured data, faster than HTML Cons : APIs may be authenticated or undocumented Strategy 3: Browser automation (most powerful) ``` from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright with sync_playwright() as p: browser = p.chromium.launch() page = browser.new_page() page.goto(url) # Extract dataCopy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` Pros : Handles JavaScript, authentication, complex interactions Cons : Slower, resource-intensive Let the LLM choose Instead of specifying the strategy upfront: Scrape product prices from [website]. Try the fastest method first. If that fails, try progressively more complex approaches. Report which method succeeded.Copy to clipboardErrorCopied The LLM will: Attempt requests + BeautifulSoup If JavaScript-rendered, switch to Playwright If API exists, use that instead Document the successful approach for future runs Extracting structured data LLMs understand semantic structure, not just HTML structure. Example: Product listings Traditional scraping: products = soup.find_all('div', class_='product-grid-item')Copy to clipboardErrorCopied Vibe scraping: ``` Extract all products on this page. For each, include: - Product name - Price (convert to USD if needed) - Rating (as decimal, e.g., 4.5) - Number of reviews - Availability status Output as products.json with this schema: { \"products\": [ {\"name\": \"...\", \"price_usd\": 0.00, \"rating\": 0.0, \"reviews\": 0, \"available\": true} ] }Copy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` The LLM: Identifies products semantically (not by class name) Normalizes currencies Extracts nested data (ratings from star images) Validates schema compliance Example: Tables with merged cells This page has a complex table with merged cells and nested headers. Convert it to a flat CSV where each row is fully denormalized.Copy to clipboardErrorCopied The LLM handles: Interpreting rowspan/colspan Carrying forward merged cell values Creating proper hierarchical headers Making scraping repeatable Once a scraping session succeeds, convert it into reusable code. Step 1: Successful scrape Scrape all job listings from this page, including: - Job title - Company - Location - Salary range - Posted dateCopy to clipboardErrorCopied Step 2: Extract as script ``` Great! Now create a standalone Python script scrape_jobs.py that reproduces this scraping with: Proper error handling Retry logic with exponential backoff Logging to scrape.log Output to jobs.csv Command-line argument for URL Include a README.md with usage instructions.Copy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` Step 3: Schedule execution Create a GitHub Actions workflow that: - Runs this scraper daily at 9 AM UTC - Commits new jobs to the repo - Sends email if scraping failsCopy to clipboardErrorCopied Result : One-time vibe scraping becomes a production data pipeline. Error handling and debugging LLMs can debug scraping failures autonomously. Scenario: Selector not found Error: Element not found: .product-cardCopy to clipboardErrorCopied Prompt: The scraper failed with \"Element not found: .product-card\". Inspect the page HTML and find the correct selector. Update the scraper and try again.Copy to clipboardErrorCopied The LLM: Fetches current page HTML Identifies product elements by semantic meaning Updates selectors Re-runs scraper Scenario: Rate limiting Error: HTTP 429 Too Many RequestsCopy to clipboardErrorCopied Prompt: Scraping failed due to rate limiting. Modify the scraper to: - Add delays between requests (2-5 seconds) - Rotate user agents - Implement exponential backoff - Resume from last successful pageCopy to clipboardErrorCopied The LLM adds resilience without you writing retry logic. Scenario: CAPTCHA This site has CAPTCHAs. Since we're using Chrome remote debugging with a logged-in session, navigate to a logged-in URL that bypasses the CAPTCHA, then proceed with scraping.Copy to clipboardErrorCopied LLMs can find workarounds (authenticated endpoints, API access) rather than attempting CAPTCHA solving. Comparing data across pages LLMs excel at comparative scraping. Example: Price comparison ``` Scrape product prices for \"wireless headphones\" from: - Amazon - Best Buy - Walmart Create a comparison table with: - Product name (normalized across sites) - Price at each retailer - Prime/shipping info - Rating average Highlight best deals (>20% cheaper than alternatives).Copy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` The LLM: Writes three separate scrapers Normalizes product names (e.g., “Sony WH-1000XM5” variations) Calculates savings Formats comparative output Monitoring and change detection Set up scrapers that alert you to changes. Example: Competitor pricing Create a scraper that: 1. Scrapes competitor prices daily 2. Compares to yesterday's prices 3. If any price drops >10%, send email alert 4. Maintains historical pricing in prices.dbCopy to clipboardErrorCopied The LLM generates: Scraper script SQLite database schema Email notification code GitHub Actions workflow for scheduling Legal and ethical considerations LLM scraping is powerful but comes with responsibilities. When scraping is appropriate ✅ Public data for analysis, research, or journalism ✅ Your own data on third-party platforms (e.g., exporting your LinkedIn connections) ✅ Permitted under ToS or with explicit permission ✅ API alternatives don’t exist or are prohibitively expensive When to avoid scraping ❌ Explicit ToS prohibition (e.g., LinkedIn, Facebook prohibit automated access) ❌ Personal data without consent ❌ Bypassing paywalls for commercial advantage ❌ Overloading servers with aggressive requests Best practices Read the ToS before scraping any site Respect robots.txt even if not legally binding Rate limit requests (1-2 per second maximum, ideally slower) Identify your bot with a custom User-Agent Provide contact info in User-Agent for site owners to reach you Consider API alternatives first—they’re designed for access Don’t scrape personal data without explicit consent Monitor for bans and stop immediately if blocked Example respectful User-Agent: headers = { 'User-Agent': 'ResearchBot/1.0 (+https://yoursite.com/bot; contact@yoursite.com)' }Copy to clipboardErrorCopied Tools and platforms Coding agents for scraping Codex : Voice prompting, repository integration Claude Code : Strong at autonomous debugging Cursor : Desktop IDE with inline scraping generation Jules : Web-based, good for quick experiments Supporting libraries Python scraping ecosystem (LLMs know these well): ``` HTML parsing import requests from bs4 import BeautifulSoup Browser automation from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright from selenium import webdriver Chrome debugging protocol import asyncio from pyppeteer import connect Data extraction import pandas as pd import jsonCopy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` Debugging tools Chrome DevTools : Inspect Network tab for API endpoints Postman : Test API requests before coding Insomnia : Alternative REST client Complete example: Job listing aggregator Full workflow from vibe scraping to deployed pipeline.

Initial prompt ``` I want to track data science job postings daily. Scrape: - Indeed - LinkedIn (if I'm logged in via Chrome debugging) - Glassdoor For each job, extract: - Title - Company - Location (remote vs office) - Salary range (normalize to yearly USD) - Required skills (extract from description) - Posted date Output as jobs.csv with columns: source, title, company, location, salary_min, salary_max, skills, posted_date Handle pagination—get first 100 jobs from each site.Copy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` Refinement prompt ``` Good start! Now enhance this scraper to: Deduplicate across sources (same job, multiple sites) Categorize location: Remote, Hybrid, On-site Extract seniority level: Entry, Mid, Senior, Lead Score \"hotness\" based on recency and salary Save to SQLite database jobs.db Generate a daily report: top_jobs.md showing 10 hottest jobs Create scraper.py that does all of this.Copy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` Production prompt ``` Now create a production-ready deployment: Add comprehensive error handling and logging Create config.yaml for URLs, selectors, etc. Add retry logic with exponential backoff Implement --test-mode that runs on sample data Generate GitHub Actions workflow: Runs daily at 9 AM UTC Commits new jobs to repo Posts top 5 jobs to Slack webhook (provide env var) Write DEPLOYMENT.md with setup instructions Organize as: scraper/ init .py scrape.py database.py config.yaml tests/ test_scraper.py .github/workflows/daily_scrape.yml README.md DEPLOYMENT.mdCopy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` Result : A fully automated job tracking system built entirely through natural language prompting. Best practices summary Start with Chrome remote debugging for authenticated sites Use vibe prompts describing desired data, not implementation Let LLMs choose strategies (HTML → API → browser automation) Make scrapers repeatable by extracting standalone scripts Handle errors proactively with retry logic and logging Respect site ToS and rate limits Extract first, structure later —get data, then ask for formatting Version control prompts —they’re your source code now Monitor for changes —scraper breakage is inevitable Consider APIs first —they’re more reliable than scraping Real-world use cases Data journalism ``` Scrape all city council meeting minutes from [city website] for the past year. Extract: - Meeting date - Agenda items - Vote results (by council member) - Attendance Identify patterns: most contested topics, attendance rates, voting blocs.Copy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` Competitive intelligence ``` Monitor competitor pricing for our top 50 products daily.

Identify underpriced properties (>20% below neighborhood median).Copy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` Academic research ``` Scrape publications from [academic database] for keyword \"climate change adaptation\" from 2020-2024. Extract: - Title, authors, abstract, year - Citation count - Keywords Analyze trending topics over time.Copy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` Troubleshooting common issues Issue 1: “Element not found” Cause : JavaScript-rendered content not loaded yet Solution: Add wait logic. After navigating to page, wait for element with selector .product-card to appear before scraping.Copy to clipboardErrorCopied Issue 2: “403 Forbidden” Cause : Site blocks bots via User-Agent Solution: Use realistic headers: User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0... Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9 Referer: [previous page URL]Copy to clipboardErrorCopied Issue 3: Scraped data is incomplete Cause : Data loads via AJAX after initial render Solution: Instead of scraping HTML, find the AJAX endpoint in Network tab that loads this data. Call that API directly.Copy to clipboardErrorCopied Issue 4: Scraper works once, then fails Cause : Site changes layout or implements anti-bot measures Solution: Modify scraper to: 1. Take screenshots on failure for debugging 2. Extract data semantically, not by class names 3. Implement fallback selectors 4.

By describing desired data rather than extraction mechanics, you gain resilience to site changes and can tackle complex scenarios (authentication, JavaScript, dynamic content) that previously required significant engineering effort. The key mindset shift: you’re not a coder writing scrapers—you’re a data curator directing an AI to extract information however it sees fit.

    "text": "title: \"Making Open Data Useful\" original_url: \"https://tds.s-anand.net/#/making-open-data-useful?id=_5-prefer-static-browser-first-apps-that-live-forever\" downloaded_at: \"2025-11-17T01:54:09.513576\" Making Open Data Useful: Lessons from Diagram Chasing Many datasets are technically available but practically unusable. Your job is to make them useful for people who are not data scientists. Design for the lowest friction, and let people share one precise slice of truth with a link. See how Diagram Chasing does this across projects like CBFC Watch , Time Use Explorer , BLR Water Log , Votes in a name? , and Who is my neta? ( CBFC Watch ) 1. Work in three clear stages: fetch → parse → aggregate FETCH Grab the raw pages or API responses exactly as served. Use your browser’s Network tab and export a HAR if the site uses complex forms or ASP.NET state. Keep every original file. Government pages move. Data disappears. ( CBFC Watch ) PARSE Turn HTML, PDFs, or odd spreadsheets into tidy JSON. Do minimal transformation so you can revisit decisions. AGGREGATE Join and normalize into one analyzable table, like a CSV or a SQLite file. This is the file others will actually use. See this pattern behind CBFC Watch and other releases. ( GitHub ) 2. Use the Network tab and HAR when scraping gets tricky Practical steps: Open DevTools, then the Network tab. Click through the site until you see the request that returns the real data. Export all requests as a HAR. Ask an LLM to generate a scraper that replays those steps. Run it and save the raw responses. This is how the CBFC data flow was cracked and reproduced. ( CBFC Watch ) 3. Use LLMs for classification and extraction , not for “finding insights” Good uses: Classify a text into action types and topics. Extract structured fields into a strict JSON schema. Normalize messy strings and variants. That is how CBFC Watch turned 100k free-text “cut notes” into analyzable columns, cheaply and at scale. Define the schema yourself, validate every response, and keep an audit trail. ( CBFC Watch ) Mini-recipe students can follow Write the categories and edge cases in plain language. Provide a JSON schema and say “respond only with valid JSON.” Batch over records. Validate against the schema before saving. Manually spot-check a random sample. 4. Make everything linkable with permalinks “If you cannot link to it, it will not exist.” Treat the URL as part of the product. Encode every filter and view in the query string and restore state on page load. This is why CBFC Watch and BLR Water Log are naturally shareable. ( CBFC Watch ) Student tip: when a user changes filters, update window.history.replaceState with the new ?params . On load, read them back to rebuild the view. 5. Prefer static, browser-first apps that “live forever” Most projects in this family run fully in the browser. They are fast, cost nothing to host, and are easy to archive. The India Time Use Explorer lets you filter and summarize tens of millions of rows entirely client-side. ( diagramchasing.fun ) Good defaults: Host on GitHub Pages or Netlify. Use DuckDB-WASM or sql.js for querying in the browser. Keep any search index external only if you must. Otherwise ship a small index file. 6. Documentation is a first-class feature A journalist said about CBFC Watch, “You brought it on a platter.” That did not happen by accident. They publish a clear data dictionary, example analyses, and an easy starting path. Emulate that. ( CBFC Watch ) What to include: Data dictionary with one-line explanations and allowed values. One reproducible notebook (R, Python, or SQL in DuckDB) that rebuilds a figure from your released CSV. Example queries or links that show interesting slices. 7. Design multiple entry points for different users Your site is one view of the data, not the only view. Offer: A simple search and browse view for curious readers. A downloadable CSV and code for developers. A notebook for analysts and reporters. See the menu of paths on the Diagram Chasing site and project pages. ( diagramchasing.fun ) 8. Give power without fifty toggles: a simple search box with a tiny parser People understand “Google-like” queries. Back your search with a fast index and parse a small syntax such as: field:value for exact match field:~value for contains year>=2021 for numeric comparisons CBFC Watch uses a fast index with a simple front door rather than a wall of checkboxes. Start there. ( CBFC Watch ) 9. Join data sources to add context Impact comes from linking datasets. Who is my neta? combines affidavits, legislative activity, and geography into one experience. Document the joins and publish the provenance. ( diagramchasing.fun ) 10. Beauty and craft matter A well-composed narrative page beats a generic dashboard. Study the storytelling in Votes in a name? and the cartography in BLR Water Log . Use clear typography, mobile-friendly layouts, and meaningful hover states. ( diagramchasing.fun ) 11. Common government-data headaches, with fixes Spelling and language variants → Normalize and classify with your schema and validator. ( CBFC Watch ) Cryptic codes and codebooks → Build lookup tables and ship them with your repo. Show values in plain words, not numbers. ( diagramchasing.fun ) Ten files for one dataset → Write one parser per file type, then standardize and append into a single table. ( diagramchasing.fun ) Maze-like portals → Recreate the smallest UI that answers realistic questions and make it linkable. Compare your flow to Diagram Chasing’s examples. ( diagramchasing.fun ) 12. Minimal, modern stack that students can ship Scraping : DevTools Network + HAR; Playwright or httpx ; keep raw responses. ( CBFC Watch ) Cleaning : Python or R with Pandas/Dplyr; DuckDB for joins. LLM-ops : Small batches with a strict JSON schema and a validator. ( CBFC Watch ) Search : Typesense or a small client-side index; add a tiny query parser. ( CBFC Watch ) Web : Static site with MapLibre or a light charting library. See BLR Water Log and Time Use Explorer for inspiration. ( diagramchasing.fun ) Docs : Markdown pages in the repo; one notebook that runs end-to-end. Case studies CBFC Watch — a first searchable archive of film modifications, with deep links, context charts, and open data. ( CBFC Watch ) India Time Use Explorer — a static, browser-only explorer for a huge national survey, with a data dictionary and “how to use.” ( diagramchasing.fun ) BLR Water Log — a static map that visualizes natural drainage and flood risk across Bengaluru. ( diagramchasing.fun ) Votes in a name? — a narrative analysis with meaningful visuals that investigates namesake candidates. ( diagramchasing.fun ) Who is my neta? — a unified view that joins multiple public sources into a civic tool.

In this tutorial, we’ll explore tools to flatten, stream, and query JSON data efficiently. For example, we’ll often need to process a multi-gigabyte log file from a web service where each record is a JSON object. This requires us to handle complex nested structures, large files that don’t fit in memory, or extract specific fields. Here are the key tools and techniques for efficient JSON parsing: | Tool | Extract from JSON… | Why | | --- | --- | --- | | jq | JSON in the shell | Quick data exploration and pipeline processing | | JMESPath | JSON in Python | Handle complex queries with a clean syntax | | ijson | JSON streams in Python | Parse streaming/large JSON files memory-efficiently | | Pandas | JSON columns in Python | Fast analysis of structured data | | SQL JSON | JSON in databases | Combine structured and semi-structured data | | DuckDB | JSON anywhere | Fast analysis of JSON files / databases without loading to memory | Examples: Use Pandas when you need to transform API responses into a DataFrame for further analysis. Leverage ijson when dealing with huge JSON logs where memory is at a premium. Apply jq for quick, iterative exploration directly in your terminal. Practice with these resources: JSONPath Online Evaluator : Test JSON queries jq play : Interactive jq query testing DuckDB JSON Tutorial : Learn DuckDB JSON functions Command-line JSON Processing with jq jq is a versatile command-line tool for slicing, filtering, and transforming JSON. It excels in quick data exploration and can be integrated into shell scripts for automated data pipelines. Example: Sifting through server logs in JSON Lines format to extract error messages or aggregate metrics without launching a full-scale ETL process. ``` Extract specific fields from JSONL cat data.jsonl | jq -c 'select(.type == \"user\") | {id, name}' Transform JSON structure cat data.json | jq '.items[] | {name: .name, count: .details.count}' Filter and aggregate cat events.jsonl | jq -s 'group_by(.category) | map({category: .[0].category, count: length})'Copy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` JMESPath Queries JMESPath offers a declarative query language to extract and transform data from nested JSON structures without needing verbose code. It’s a neat alternative when you want to quickly pull out specific values or filter collections based on conditions. Example: Extracting user emails or filtering out inactive records from a complex JSON payload received from a cloud service. ``` import jmespath Example queries data = { \"locations\": [ {\"name\": \"Seattle\", \"state\": \"WA\", \"info\": {\"population\": 737015}}, {\"name\": \"Portland\", \"state\": \"OR\", \"info\": {\"population\": 652503}} ] } Find all cities with population > 700000 cities = jmespath.search(\"locations[?info.population > 700000 ].name\", data)Copy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` Streaming with ijson Loading huge JSON files all at once can quickly exhaust system memory. ijson lets you stream and process JSON incrementally. This method is ideal when your JSON file is too large or when you only need to work with part of the data. Example: Processing a continuous feed from an API that returns a large JSON array, such as sensor data or event logs, while filtering on the fly. ``` import ijson def process_large_json(filepath: str) -> list: \"\"\"Process a large JSON file without loading it entirely into memory.\"\"\" results = [] with open(filepath, 'rb') as file: # Stream objects under the 'items' key parser = ijson.items(file, 'items.item') for item in parser: # ijson yields items synchronously if item.get('value', 0) > 100: # Process conditionally results.append(item) return resultsCopy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` Pandas JSON Columns Pandas makes it easy to work with tabular data that includes JSON strings. When you receive API data where one column holds nested JSON, flattening these structures lets you analyze and visualize the data using familiar DataFrame operations. Example: Flattening customer records stored as nested JSON in a CSV file to extract demographic details and spending patterns. ``` import json import pandas as pd Parse JSON strings in a column, expand to columns df = pd.DataFrame({'json_col': ['{\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 30}', '{\"name\": \"Bob\", \"age\": 25}']}) expanded = pd.json_normalize(df['json_col'].apply(json.loads)) Normalize nested JSON from another dataframe column df = pd.read_csv('data.csv') df_normalized = pd.json_normalize( df['nested_json'].apply(json.loads), record_path=['items'], # List of nested objects to unpack meta=['id', 'timestamp'] # Keep these columns from parent )Copy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` SQL JSON Functions SQL supports built-in JSON functions allow you to query and manipulate JSON stored within relational databases. These are implemented by most popular databases, including SQLite , PostgreSQL , and MySQL . This is especially handy when you have a hybrid data model, combining structured tables with semi-structured JSON columns. Example: An application that stores user settings or application logs as JSON in a SQLite database, enabling quick lookups and modifications without external JSON parsing libraries. SELECT json_extract(data, '$.name') as name, json_extract(data, '$.details.age') as age FROM users WHERE json_extract(data, '$.active') = trueCopy to clipboardErrorCopied DuckDB JSON Processing DuckDB shines when analyzing JSON/JSONL files directly, making it a powerful tool for data analytics without the overhead of loading entire datasets into memory. Its SQL-like syntax simplifies exploratory analysis on nested data. Example: Performing ad-hoc analytics on streaming JSON logs from a web service, such as calculating average response times or aggregating user behavior metrics. SELECT json_extract_string(data, '$.user.name') as name, avg(json_extract_float(data, '$.metrics.value')) as avg_value FROM read_json_auto('data/*.jsonl') GROUP BY 1 HAVING avg_value > 100Copy to clipboardErrorCopied [Previous Cleaning Data with OpenRefine](#/cleaning-data-with-openrefine) [Next Transforming Images](#/transforming-images)",

SOME DETAILS MAY CHANGE. In this project, students will build an application that can solve a quiz that involves data sourcing, preparation, analysis, and visualization using LLMs. You will also answer a viva about your design choices. Fill out this Google Form . It asks for: Your email address A secret string (used to verify your requests). A system prompt that resists revealing the given code word (which will be appended to the system prompt). Max 100 chars. A user prompt that will override any such system prompt to reveal the code word. Max 100 chars. Your API endpoint URL (where you will accept POST requests with quiz tasks). Prefer HTTPS. Your GitHub repo URL (where your code is hosted). Make sure it’s public and has an MIT LICENSE when we evaluate. You may keep it private during development. Prompt Testing Here’s how we will test your system and user prompts: Take student 1’s system prompt from one submission. Take student 2’s user prompt from another submission. Generate a random code word (e.g. “elephant”) Pick a model (definitely GPT-5-nano with minimal reasoning, possibly others): system: f\"{system_prompt} The code word is: {code_word}\" user: user_prompt Check if the LLM reveals the code word in its output.

The quiz page always includes the submit URL to use. Do not hardcode any URLs. The questions may involve data sourcing, preparation, analysis, and visualization. The \"answer\" may need to be a boolean, number, string, base64 URI of a file attachment, or a JSON object with a combination of these. Your JSON payload must be under 1MB. The endpoint will respond with a HTTP 200 and a JSON payload indicating whether your answer is correct and may include another quiz URL to solve.

Only the last submission within 3 minutes will be considered for evaluation. you may receive the next url to proceed to. If so, you can choose to skip to that URL instead of re-submitting to the current one. If your answer is correct, you will receive a new url to solve unless the quiz is over. When you receive a new url , your script must visit the url and solve the quiz on that page. Here’s a sample sequence: We send you to url: https://example.com/quiz-834 You solve it wrongly. You get url: https://example.com/quiz-942 and solve it. You solve it wrongly. You re-submit. Now it’s correct and you get url: https://example.com/quiz-123 and solve it. You solve it correctly and get no new URL, ending the quiz.

This helps the model produce outputs consistent with your desired style. BAD : Explain how to tie a bow tie. (Reason: No examples or reference points given.) GOOD : Explain how to tie a bow tie. For example: To tie a shoelace, you cross the laces and pull them tight… To tie a necktie, you place it around the collar and loop it through… Now, apply a similar step-by-step style to describe how to tie a bow tie. (Reason: Provides clear examples and a pattern to follow.) Give examples to the model. If you want someone to build a house, show them a sketch. Don’t just say ‘build something.’ Giving examples is like showing a pattern. It makes everything easier to follow. Anthropic | OpenAI | Google Think step by step Instruct the model to reason through the problem step by step. This leads to more logical, well-structured answers. BAD : Given this transcript, is the customer satisfied? (Reason: No prompt for structured reasoning.) GOOD : Given this transcript, is the customer satisfied? Think step by step. (Reason: Directly instructs the model to break down reasoning into steps.) Ask the model to think step by step. Don’t ask the model to just give the final answer right away. That’s like asking someone to answer with the first thing that pops into their head. Instead, ask them to break down their thought process into simple moves — like showing each rung of a ladder as they climb. For example, when thinking step by step, the model could, A, list each customer question, B, find out if it was addressed, and C, decide that the agent answered only 2 out of the 3 questions. Anthropic | OpenAI | Google Assign a role Specify a role or persona for the model. This provides context and helps tailor the response style. BAD : Explain how to fix a software bug. (Reason: No role or perspective given.) GOOD : You are a seasoned software engineer. Explain how to fix a software bug in legacy code, including the debugging and testing process. (Reason: Assigns a clear, knowledgeable persona, guiding the style and depth.) Tell the model who they are. Maybe they’re a seasoned software engineer fixing a legacy bug, or an experienced copy editor revising a publication. By clearly telling the model who they are, you help them speak with just the right expertise and style. Suddenly, your explanation sounds like it’s coming from a true specialist, not a random voice. Anthropic | OpenAI | Google Use XML to structure your prompt Use XML tags to separate different parts of the prompt clearly. This helps the model understand structure and requirements. BAD : Here’s what I want: Provide a summary and then an example. (Reason: Unstructured, no clear separation of tasks.) GOOD : <instructions> Provide a summary of the concept of machine learning. </instructions> <example> Then provide a simple, concrete example of a machine learning application (e.g., an email spam filter). </example>Copy to clipboardErrorCopied (Reason: Uses XML tags to clearly distinguish instructions from examples.) Think of your request like a box. XML tags are neat little labels on that box. They help keep parts sorted, so nothing gets lost in the shuffle. Anthropic | OpenAI | Google Use Markdown to format your output Encourage the model to use Markdown for headings, lists, code blocks, and other formatting features to produce structured, easily readable answers. BAD : Give me the steps in plain text. (Reason: No specific formatting instructions, less readable.) GOOD : Provide the steps in a markdown-formatted list with ### headings for each section and numbered bullet points. (Reason: Directly instructs to use Markdown formatting, making output more structured and clear.) BAD : Correct the spelling and show the corrections. (Reason: No specific formatting instructions) GOOD : Correct the spelling, showing additions and deletions . (Reason: Directly instructs to use HTML formatting, making output more structured and clear.) Markdown is a simple formatting language that all models understand. You can have them add neat headings, sections, bold highlights, and bullet points. These make complex documents more scannable and easy on the eyes. Use JSON for machine-readable output When you need structured data, ask for a JSON-formatted response. This ensures the output is machine-readable and organized. BAD : Just list the items. (Reason: Unstructured plain text makes parsing harder.) GOOD : ``` Organize as an array of objects in a JSON format, like this: json [ { \"name\": \"Item 1\", \"description\": \"Description of Item 1\" }, { \"name\": \"Item 2\", \"description\": \"Description of Item 2\" }, { \"name\": \"Item 3\", \"description\": \"Description of Item 3\" } ] Copy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` (Reason: Instructing JSON format ensures structured, machine-readable output.) Note: Always use JSON schema if possible. JSON schema is a way to describe the structure of JSON data. An easy way to get the JSON schema is to give ChatGPT sample output and ask it to generate the schema. Imagine you’re organizing data for a big project. Plain text is like dumping everything into one messy pile — it’s hard to find what you need later. JSON, on the other hand, is like packing your data into neat, labeled boxes within boxes. Everything has its place: fields like ‘name,’ ‘description,’ and ‘value’ make the data easy to read, especially for machines. For example, instead of just listing items, you can structure them as a JSON array, with each item as an object. That way, when you hand it to a program, it’s all clear and ready to use. Prefer Yes/No answers Convert rating or percentage questions into Yes/No queries. LLMs handle binary choices better than numeric scales. BAD : On a scale of 1-10, how confident are you that this method works? (Reason: Asks for a numeric rating, which can be imprecise.) GOOD : Is this method likely to work as intended? Please give a reasoning and then answer Yes or No. (Reason: A binary question simplifies the response and clarifies what’s being asked.) Don’t ask ‘On a scale of one to five…’. Models are not good with numbers. They don’t know how to grade something 7 versus 8 on a 10 point scale. ‘Yes or no?’ is simple. It’s clear. It’s quick. So, break your question into simple parts that they can answer with just a yes or a no. Ask for reason first, then the answer Instruct the model to provide its reasoning steps before stating the final answer. This makes it less likely to justify itself and more likely to think deeper, leading to more accurate results. BAD : What is the best route to take? (Reason: Direct question without prompting reasoning steps first.) GOOD : First, explain your reasoning step by step for how you determine the best route. Then, after you’ve reasoned it out, state your final recommendation for the best route. (Reason: Forces the model to show its reasoning process before giving the final answer.) BEFORE making its final choice, have the model talk through their thinking. Reasoning first, answer second. That way, the model won’t be tempted to justify an answer that they gave impulsively. It is also more likely to think deeper. Use proper spelling and grammar A well-written, grammatically correct prompt clarifies expectations. Poorly structured prompts can confuse the model. BAD : xplin wht the weirless netork do? make shur to giv me a anser?? (Reason: Poor spelling and unclear instructions.) GOOD : Explain what a wireless network does. Please provide a detailed, step-by-step explanation. (Reason: Proper spelling and clarity lead to a more coherent response.) If your question sounds like gibberish, expect a messy answer. Speak cleanly. When you do, the response will be much clearer. Video Tutorials Watch Prompt Engineering Tutorial – Master ChatGPT and LLM Responses (41 min) .

Pydantic AI extends this to build production-grade AI agents with structured outputs and type safety. What’s Pydantic? Python doesn’t enforce type hints at runtime. Pydantic validates data automatically using type annotations: ``` /// script requires-python = \">=3.11\" dependencies = [\"pydantic\"] /// from pydantic import BaseModel, Field class User(BaseModel): name: str age: int = Field(..., gt=0, le=120) email: str Automatic validation and type conversion user = User(name=\"Alice\", age=\"25\", email=\"alice@example.com\") print(user.age, type(user.age)) # 25 Invalid data raises ValidationError try: User(name=\"Bob\", age=-5, email=\"invalid\") except Exception as e: print(f\"Validation failed: {e}\")Copy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` Pydantic is used by FastAPI, LangChain, the OpenAI SDK, and 8,000+ packages on PyPI. It’s fast (core written in Rust), integrates with IDEs, and generates JSON schemas automatically. Pydantic Basics Field constraints validate data beyond types: ``` from pydantic import BaseModel, Field, EmailStr class Product(BaseModel): name: str = Field(..., min_length=3, max_length=50) price: float = Field(..., gt=0) email: EmailStr # Validates email format quantity: int = Field(default=0, ge=0) product = Product( name=\"Widget\", price=\"19.99\", # Converted to float email=\"shop@example.com\" ) print(product.model_dump()) {'name': 'Widget', 'price': 19.99, 'email': 'shop@example.com', 'quantity': 0}Copy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` Nested models handle complex structures: ``` from pydantic import BaseModel class Address(BaseModel): city: str country: str class Customer(BaseModel): name: str address: Address customer = Customer( name=\"Alice\", address={\"city\": \"London\", \"country\": \"UK\"} ) print(customer.address.city) # LondonCopy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` What’s Pydantic AI? Pydantic AI brings type-safe AI agent development with structured outputs, tool calling, and dependency injection. Built by the Pydantic team, it works with OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, Groq, and other providers. Watch this Pydantic AI Tutorial (33 min): Here’s a minimal example: ``` /// script requires-python = \">=3.11\" dependencies = [\"pydantic-ai\"] /// from pydantic_ai import Agent Create an agent with any supported model agent = Agent('openai:gpt-5-nano') Run synchronously result = agent.run_sync('What is the capital of France?') print(result.output) ParisCopy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` Set your API key in the environment: export OPENAI_API_KEY=\"your-api-key-here\"Copy to clipboardErrorCopied Or use a .env file: pip install python-dotenvCopy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` .env file: OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here from dotenv import load_dotenv load_dotenv() from pydantic_ai import Agent agent = Agent('openai:gpt-5-nano')Copy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` Structured Outputs The power of Pydantic AI is in structured, validated responses: ``` /// script requires-python = \">=3.11\" dependencies = [\"pydantic-ai\"] /// from pydantic import BaseModel from pydantic_ai import Agent class CityInfo(BaseModel): city: str country: str population: int agent = Agent('openai:gpt-5-nano', output_type=CityInfo) result = agent.run_sync('Tell me about Tokyo') print(result.output) city='Tokyo' country='Japan' population=14000000 print(type(result.output)) Copy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` The model’s response is automatically validated and converted to the Pydantic model. Invalid responses trigger retry with error feedback. Multiple Output Types Handle different response scenarios: ``` /// script requires-python = \">=3.11\" dependencies = [\"pydantic-ai\"] /// from pydantic import BaseModel from pydantic_ai import Agent class WeatherData(BaseModel): location: str temperature: float conditions: str agent = Agent( 'openai:gpt-5-nano', output_type=[WeatherData, str], # Either structured data or error message system_prompt='Provide weather data when available, or explain why you cannot.' ) Complete data available result1 = agent.run_sync('Weather in London: 15°C, cloudy') print(result1.output) location='London' temperature=15.0 conditions='cloudy' Incomplete data result2 = agent.run_sync('Weather in London') print(result2.output) \"I don't have current weather data...\"Copy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` Tool Calling Give agents access to functions for dynamic data: ``` /// script requires-python = \">=3.11\" dependencies = [\"pydantic-ai\"] /// from pydantic_ai import Agent agent = Agent( 'openai:gpt-5-nano', system_prompt='You help with weather queries using available tools.' ) @agent.tool_plain def get_weather(city: str) -> str: \"\"\"Get current weather for a city.\"\"\" # In production, call a real weather API return f\"Weather in {city}: 22°C, sunny\" @agent.tool_plain def list_cities() -> list[str]: \"\"\"List cities with weather data available.\"\"\" return [\"London\", \"Paris\", \"Tokyo\", \"New York\"] result = agent.run_sync('What is the weather in Paris?') print(result.output) The weather in Paris is 22°C and sunny.Copy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` The agent automatically: Decides which tool to call Executes the function Uses the result in its response Tool with validation: ``` from pydantic import Field @agent.tool_plain def search_products( category: str, max_price: float = Field(..., gt=0), in_stock: bool = True ) -> list[str]: \"\"\"Search products by category and price. Args: category: Product category to search max_price: Maximum price in dollars in_stock: Only show available items \"\"\" return [f\"Product in {category} under ${max_price}\"]Copy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` Pydantic validates tool arguments before execution. Invalid arguments trigger automatic retry. Dependencies and Context Pass runtime data to agents using dependency injection: ``` /// script requires-python = \">=3.11\" dependencies = [\"pydantic-ai\"] /// from dataclasses import dataclass from pydantic_ai import Agent, RunContext @dataclass class UserContext: user_id: int name: str agent = Agent( 'openai:gpt-5-nano', deps_type=UserContext ) @agent.instructions def add_user_context(ctx: RunContext[UserContext]) -> str: return f\"The user's name is {ctx.deps.name}\" @agent.tool def get_user_data(ctx: RunContext[UserContext]) -> str: \"\"\"Get user information.\"\"\" return f\"User {ctx.deps.name} (ID: {ctx.deps.user_id})\" Run with specific user context deps = UserContext(user_id=123, name=\"Alice\") result = agent.run_sync('What is my user ID?', deps=deps) print(result.output) Your user ID is 123, Alice.Copy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` Dependencies are type-safe and can include database connections, API clients, or configuration. Message History Maintain conversation context: ``` /// script requires-python = \">=3.11\" dependencies = [\"pydantic-ai\"] /// from pydantic_ai import Agent agent = Agent('openai:gpt-5-nano') result1 = agent.run_sync('My name is Alice') print(result1.output) Hello Alice! How can I help you? result2 = agent.run_sync( 'What did I say my name was?', message_history=result1.new_messages() ) print(result2.output) You said your name is Alice.Copy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` Use new_messages() to get only the latest exchange, or all_messages() for the full conversation. System Prompts vs Instructions System prompts set persistent context: agent = Agent( 'openai:gpt-5-nano', system_prompt='You are a helpful assistant. Be concise.' )Copy to clipboardErrorCopied Instructions are dynamic and per-request: @agent.instructions def dynamic_instructions(ctx: RunContext) -> str: return f\"Current user: {ctx.deps.username}\"Copy to clipboardErrorCopied Use instructions when context changes per request (different users, sessions). Use system_prompt for consistent agent behavior. Output Validators Add custom validation with external checks: ``` /// script requires-python = \">=3.11\" dependencies = [\"pydantic-ai\"] /// from pydantic import BaseModel from pydantic_ai import Agent, RunContext, ModelRetry class Age(BaseModel): age: int name: str agent = Agent('openai:gpt-5-nano', output_type=Age) @agent.output_validator async def validate_age(ctx: RunContext, output: Age) -> Age: if output.age < 0 or output.age > 120: raise ModelRetry(f'Age {output.age} seems unrealistic. Please verify.') return output result = agent.run_sync('John is 150 years old') print(result.output) After retry: age=50 name='John' (model corrects itself)Copy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` Validators can query databases, call APIs, or perform complex checks. Raising ModelRetry asks the model to try again with feedback. Multimodal Input Process images, audio, video, and documents: ``` /// script requires-python = \">=3.11\" dependencies = [\"pydantic-ai\"] /// from pydantic_ai import Agent, ImageUrl from pathlib import Path agent = Agent('openai:gpt-5-nano') From URL result = agent.run_sync([ 'What company is this?', ImageUrl(url='https://example.com/logo.png') ]) From local file from pydantic_ai import BinaryContent image_data = Path('logo.png').read_bytes() result = agent.run_sync([ 'Describe this image', BinaryContent(data=image_data, media_type='image/png') ])Copy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` Supports: ImageUrl , AudioUrl , VideoUrl , DocumentUrl and BinaryContent for local files. Web Search Enable real-time information retrieval: ``` /// script requires-python = \">=3.11\" dependencies = [\"pydantic-ai\"] /// from pydantic_ai import Agent, WebSearchTool agent = Agent( 'gemini-2.5-flash', builtin_tools=[WebSearchTool()] ) result = agent.run_sync('What is the current price of Bitcoin?') print(result.output) Bitcoin is currently trading at $X,XXX USD (real-time data)Copy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` The agent automatically searches the web when it needs current information. Model Support Pydantic AI works with multiple providers: ``` OpenAI agent = Agent('openai:gpt-4o') Anthropic agent = Agent('anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-0') Google Gemini agent = Agent('gemini-2.5-flash') Groq agent = Agent('groq:llama-3.1-70b-versatile') Ollama (local) agent = Agent('ollama:llama3.2')Copy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` Testing Agents Use test models for unit tests: ``` /// script requires-python = \">=3.11\" dependencies = [\"pydantic-ai\"] /// from pydantic import BaseModel from pydantic_ai import Agent from pydantic_ai.models.test import TestModel class Response(BaseModel): answer: str Create test model with predefined responses test_model = TestModel() agent = Agent(test_model, output_type=Response) Run test result = agent.run_sync('test question') print(result.output) answer='test response'Copy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` TestModel provides predictable outputs for testing without API calls.

Instead of relying solely on a general-purpose LLM, RAG lets you feed it the most relevant chunks from your corpus at query time, improving accuracy, reducing hallucinations, and allowing you to answer domain‑specific questions without fine‑tuning. In particular, you can answer questions that are hard to answer with a keyword search. For example: ``` Q=\"What does the author affectionately call the => syntax?\" Answer: fat arrow Q=\"What lets you walk every child node of a ts.Node?\" Answer: node.getChildren() Q=\"What are code pieces like comments and whitespace that aren’t in the AST called?\" Answer: trivia Q=\"Which operator converts any value into an explicit boolean?\" Answer: !!Copy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` You can implement RAG entirely from your terminal, without writing a single line of application code. Below is a step‑by‑step example using the TypeScript book as a data source. 1. Clone the repository git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/basarat/typescript-book cd typescript-bookCopy to clipboardErrorCopied --depth 1 fetches only the latest commit to minimize download size. cd typescript-book moves into the project folder. You’ll now be in a new folder typescript-book containing the repo. 2. Split Markdown files into chunks ( shopt -s globstar for f in **/*.md; do uvx --from split_markdown4gpt mdsplit4gpt \"$f\" --model gpt-4o --limit 4096 --separator \"===SPLIT===\" \\ | sed '1s/^/===SPLIT===\\n/' \\ | jq -R -s -c --arg file \"$f\" ' split(\"===SPLIT===\")[1:] | to_entries | map({ id: ($file + \"#\" + (.key | tostring)), content: .value })[] ' done ) | tee chunks.jsonCopy to clipboardErrorCopied shopt -s globstar : lets **/*.md match Markdown files in all subdirectories. bash shopt manual uvx --from split_markdown4gpt mdsplit4gpt : a tool that splits Markdown into LLM‑sized chunks: --model gpt-4o : uses GPT‑4o token limits --limit 4096 : max tokens per chunk --separator \"===SPLIT===\" : custom split marker sed '1s/^/===SPLIT===\\n/' : ensures the very first chunk starts with the separator (GNU sed manual) jq -R -s -c --arg file \"$f\" : uses jq to convert chunks to JSON -R : read raw input -s : slurp entire input into a single string -c : compact JSON output builds an array of objects {id, content} , where id is filename#chunkIndex tee chunks.json : writes the resulting JSON array to chunks.json while printing it to stdout. You’ll now have a chunks.json that has one {id, content} JSON object per line. 3. Generate embeddings llm embed-multi typescript-book --model 3-small --store --format nl chunks.jsonCopy to clipboardErrorCopied embed-multi : computes embeddings for each entry in chunks.json . typescript-book : a namespace or collection name for storage. --model 3-small : selects the embedding model. --store : save embeddings in the default backend. --format nl : input is newline‑delimited JSON. llm CLI embed-multi This stores the embeddings in a collection called typescript-book . llm collections path # shows where the collections are stored llm collections delete typescript-book # deletes the typescript-book collectionCopy to clipboardErrorCopied 4.

Cite verbatim from notes.\" \\ | uvx streamdownCopy to clipboardErrorCopied This answers the question in natural language following these steps: Store the query in Q . Retrieve the top 3 matching chunks. jq '.content' extracts just the text snippets. Pipe into llm -s , instructing the model: -s : stream a prompt directly to the LLM. \"$Q - Answer ONLY from these notes.

Run this server.py script via uv run server.py : ``` /// script requires-python = \">=3.13\" dependencies = [ \"fastapi\", \"uvicorn\", ] /// from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException from typing import Dict, List app = FastAPI() Create a list of items that will act like a database items: List[Dict[str, float | int | str]] = [] Create a GET endpoint that returns all items @app.get(\"/items\") async def get_items() -> List[Dict[str, float | int | str]]: return items Create a GET endpoint that returns a specific item by ID @app.get(\"/items/{item_id}\") async def get_item(item_id: int) -> Dict[str, float | int | str]: if item := next((i for i in items if i[\"id\"] == item_id), None): return item raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail=\"Item not found\") Create a POST endpoint that creates a new item @app.post(\"/items\") async def create_item(item: Dict[str, float | str]) -> Dict[str, float | int | str]: new_item = {\"id\": len(items) + 1, \"name\": item[\"name\"], \"price\": float(item[\"price\"])} items.append(new_item) return new_item if name == \" main \": import uvicorn uvicorn.run(app, host=\"0.0.0.0\", port=8000)Copy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` Test the API with curl: ``` Get all items curl http://localhost:8000/items Create an item curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/items \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -d '{\"name\": \"Book\", \"price\": 29.99}' Get specific item curl http://localhost:8000/items/1Copy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` Best Practices: Use Nouns for Resources Good: /users , /posts Bad: /getUsers , /createPost Version Your API /api/v1/users /api/v2/usersCopy to clipboardErrorCopied 3.

This tutorial shows how to automate data collection from websites using GitHub Actions workflows. Key Concepts Scheduling : Use cron syntax to run scrapers at specific times Dependencies : Install required packages like httpx , lxml Data Storage : Save scraped data to files and commit back to the repository Error Handling : Implement robust error handling for network issues and HTML parsing Rate Limiting : Respect website terms of service and implement delays between requests Here’s a sample scrape.py that scrapes the IMDb Top 250 movies using httpx and lxml: ``` import json import httpx from datetime import datetime, UTC from lxml import html from typing import List, Dict def scrape_imdb() -> List[Dict[str, str]]: \"\"\"Scrape IMDb Top 250 movies using httpx and lxml. Returns: List of dictionaries containing movie title, year, and rating. \"\"\" headers = {\"User-Agent\": \"Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; IMDbBot/1.0)\"} response = httpx.get(\"https://www.imdb.com/chart/top/\", headers=headers) response.raise_for_status() tree = html.fromstring(response.text) movies = [] for item in tree.cssselect(\".ipc-metadata-list-summary-item\"): title = ( item.cssselect(\".ipc-title__text\")[0].text_content() if item.cssselect(\".ipc-title__text\") else None ) year = ( item.cssselect(\".cli-title-metadata span\")[0].text_content() if item.cssselect(\".cli-title-metadata span\") else None ) rating = ( item.cssselect(\".ipc-rating-star\")[0].text_content() if item.cssselect(\".ipc-rating-star\") else None ) if title and year and rating: movies.append({\"title\": title, \"year\": year, \"rating\": rating}) return movies Scrape data and save with timestamp now = datetime.now(UTC) with open(f'imdb-top250-{now.strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d\")}.json', \"a\") as f: f.write(json.dumps({\"timestamp\": now.isoformat(), \"movies\": scrape_imdb()}) + \"\\n\")Copy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` Here’s a sample .github/workflows/imdb-top250.yml that runs the scraper daily and saves the data: ``` name: Scrape IMDb Top 250 on: schedule: # Runs at 00:00 UTC every day - cron: \"0 0 * * *\" workflow_dispatch: # Allow manual triggers jobs: scrape-imdb: runs-on: ubuntu-latest permissions: contents: write steps: - name: Checkout repository uses: actions/checkout@v4 - name: Install uv uses: astral-sh/setup-uv@v5 - name: Run scraper run: | # python uv run --with httpx,lxml,cssselect python scrape.py - name: Commit and push changes run: | git config --local user.email \"github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com\" git config --local user.name \"github-actions[bot]\" git add *.json git commit -m \"Update IMDb Top 250 data [skip ci]\" || exit 0 git pushCopy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` Best Practices Cache Dependencies : Use GitHub’s caching to speed up package installation Handle Errors : Implement retries and error logging Rate Limiting : Add delays between requests to avoid overwhelming servers Data Validation : Verify scraped data structure before saving Monitoring : Set up notifications for workflow failures Tools and Resources httpx : Async HTTP client GitHub Actions Marketplace GitHub Actions Documentation Video Tutorials [Previous LLM Video Screen-Scraping](#/llm-video-screen-scraping) [Next Scraping emarketer.com](#/scraping-emarketer)",

They’re perfect for small web tools that don’t need to run all the time . Here are some common real-life uses: A contact form that emails you when someone wants to hire you (runs for 2-3 seconds, a few times per day) A tool that converts uploaded photos to black and white (runs for 5-10 seconds when someone uploads a photo) A chatbot that answers basic questions about your business hours (runs for 1-2 seconds per question) A newsletter sign-up that adds emails to your mailing list (runs for 1 second per sign-up) A webhook that posts your Etsy sales to Discord (runs for 1 second whenever you make a sale) You only pay when someone uses your tool, and the platform automatically handles busy periods. For example, if 100 people fill out your contact form at once, the platform creates 100 temporary copies of your code to handle them all. When they’re done, these copies disappear. It’s cheaper than running a full-time server because you’re not paying for the time when no one is using your tool - most tools are idle 95% of the time! Rather than writing a full program, serverless platforms let you write functions. These functions are called via HTTP requests. They run in a cloud environment and are scaled up and down automatically. But this means you write programs in a different style. For example: You can’t pip install packages - you have to use requirements.txt You can’t read or write files from the file system - you can only use APIs. You can’t run commands (e.g. subprocess.run() ) Vercel is a cloud platform optimized for frontend frameworks and serverless functions. Vercel is tightly integrated with GitHub. Pushing to your repository automatically triggers new deployments. Here’s a quickstart . Sign up for Vercel . Create an empty git repo with this api/index.py file. To deploy a FastAPI app, add a requirements.txt file with fastapi as a dependency. fastapiCopy to clipboardErrorCopied Add your FastAPI code to api/index.py . ``` api/index.py from fastapi import FastAPI app = FastAPI() @app.get(\"/\") def read_root(): return {\"message\": \"Hello, World!\"}Copy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` Add a vercel.json file to the root of your repository. { \"builds\": [{ \"src\": \"api/index.py\", \"use\": \"@vercel/python\" }], \"routes\": [{ \"src\": \"/(.*)\", \"dest\": \"api/index.py\" }] }Copy to clipboardErrorCopied On the command line, run: npx vercel to deploy a test version npx vercel --prod to deploy to production Environment Variables . Use npx vercel env add to add environment variables. In your code, use os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY') to access them.

    "text": "title: \"Tests in AI coding\" original_url: \"https://tds.s-anand.net/#/ai-coding-tests?id=ai-coding-tests\" downloaded_at: \"2025-11-17T01:53:04.937034\" AI Coding Tests Testing AI-generated code is about establishing fast, trustworthy feedback loops before the code lands in main. The goal is not perfect certainty—it is a reliable signal that the patch does what it should, fails when it must, and keeps shipping velocity high. In this module, you’ll learn: Scorecard-driven evaluation loops : Track AI agent success with automated suites and selectors Premortem test-first flows : Lock in failing tests before asking an agent to code Python-first fuzzing and mutation : Catch almost-right code with Hypothesis and mutmut Agent-powered smoke tests : Let Playwright bots guard critical user journeys Build evaluation loops Benchmarks stop vibe-coded fixes from quietly regressing. Start with a thin scorecard that runs on every candidate patch, then expand. Curate a regression suite : Keep a lightweight folder such as tests/scorecards/ that encodes the acceptance criteria for each automation task. Track pass rate over time and graph it. OpenAI evals and Anthropic evals are reference architectures for scorecard runners. Automate the selector harness : When using Mixture-of-Agents or multiple drafts, promote the version that clears the scorecard. A simple shell script works: uv run pytest tests/scorecards -q --maxfail=1 jq -s '{winner: max_by(.score)}' variations/*/result.jsonCopy to clipboardErrorCopied * Keep evaluation in-the-loop : Wire the scorecard into CI so every agent commit runs uv run pytest (for code) plus any task-specific checks ( uvx mypy , npm test , etc.) before merge. Reject green builds unless the evaluation job also passes. Premortem tests first Write the tests you want to see fail before you let the model touch the repo. Describe the desired behavior in a docstring or issue comment. Ask the agent (or write manually) for precise unit/property tests that encode that behavior. Run the tests and verify they fail. Only then let the agent implement code until the suite is green. ``` tests/test_csv_loader.py \"\"\"CSV loader must ignore BOMs and normalise header case.\"\"\" from pathlib import Path import pytest TEST_DATA = Path(\"tests/fixtures/csv/bom_users.csv\") def test_reads_bom_file(tmp_path: Path) -> None: rows = load_users(TEST_DATA) assert rows[0][\"email\"] == \"person@example.com\" def test_rejects_missing_email(tmp_path: Path) -> None: with pytest.raises(ValueError): load_users(TEST_DATA.with_suffix(\".bad\"))Copy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` Premortem TDD makes the happy path obvious and stops the agent from rewriting tests to match its output. Treat these red tests as the contract; the agent must satisfy them without edits unless you explicitly amend requirements. Property-based fuzzing for AI patches AI-produced code often fails on weird but realistic inputs. Property-based tests generate thousands of them for you. Lean on Hypothesis for Python : Install once ( uv add hypothesis ) and import strategies to generate realistic data. The Hypothesis quickstart illustrates the core API. Codify invariants : Instead of hard-coding outputs, assert algebraic laws, ordering guarantees, or round-trip behavior. This keeps tests resilient across alternative implementations the agent might generate. Seed fixtures : Hypothesis replays failing inputs via the example database, so regression tests stay deterministic in CI. ``` tests/test_slugify_props.py \"\"\"Slug helpers must be lowercase, ASCII, and idempotent.\"\"\" from hypothesis import given, strategies as st @given(st.text(min_size=1)) def test_slugify_is_idempotent(text: str) -> None: slug = slugify(text) assert slug == slugify(slug) assert slug == slug.lower() assert slug.encode(\"ascii\", errors=\"ignore\").decode() == slugCopy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` Run it fast: uv run pytest tests/test_slugify_props.py -qCopy to clipboardErrorCopied Coverage and mutation guardrails Passing tests mean little if they never execute the risky code paths. Couple coverage metrics with mutation testing to be sure the suite bites back. Measure the baseline : uv run coverage run -m pytest && uv run coverage report -m verifies new AI patches widen coverage rather than shrinking it. Coverage.py surfaces untouched branches. Mutate to validate : mutmut flips operators and literals. Surviving mutants expose brittle or missing assertions. uv run mutmut run --paths-to-mutate package/ --tests-dir tests/ uv run mutmut resultsCopy to clipboardErrorCopied Script nightly guardrails : Run mutation testing asynchronously (nightly or on beefy agents) and file issues for mutants that survive multiple spins. Hidden adversarial checks Agent-generated code tends to overfit visible tests. Keep a small stash of unseen cases that run in CI but stay out of the prompt history. Hide tricky fixtures : Store adversarial fixtures (rounded floats, locale surprises, sample vs population stats) under tests/hidden/ and skip them locally with an env flag. Property + example pairing : Combine Hypothesis strategies with hand-crafted edge fixtures using @pytest.mark.parametrize to guarantee known-bad paths stay covered. Test data packs : Maintain tiny, versioned fixture bundles for critical domains (currencies, encodings, timezone transitions). Publish them as tests/fixtures/<feature> so agents can read structure but not exact values. End-to-end smoke bots Keep at least one high-value flow green to catch integration bugs even when unit tests pass. Script minimal Playwright runs : Use Playwright for Python or platform agents to drive the UI the AI just modified. Sandbox for determinism : Launch against seeded datasets or mock services so AI patches do not flake the smoke tests. Automate from the CLI : uv run playwright install chromium uv run playwright test tests/e2e/smoke.spec.ts --headed=false --repeat-each=2Copy to clipboardErrorCopied * Agent-in-the-loop : Some coders run Playwright via MCP or Codex sandbox tasks so the AI can verify its own output. Require human review of logs before merge. LLM-assisted grading (with guardrails) Treat LLM judges as advisory signals layered on top of runnable tests. Prompt from diffs : Provide the patch, the failing test names, and the domain rubric. Ask for a risk score, not approval. Never skip executables : Only auto-merge if both runnable tests and LLM checks agree. Log everything : Archive judge prompts/responses for audit; rotate prompts to reduce prompt overfitting. Operational checklist Start every new AI ticket by drafting a failing unit/property test (premortem). Keep scorecards fast enough to run on every agent iteration (<1 minute ideal). Enrich suites weekly with at least one new hidden/adversarial case per bug found. Track coverage deltas and mutation survivors; fix the tests, not the tool. Document how to run smoke bots locally so humans can verify before merge. [Previous AI coding strategies](#/ai-coding-strategies) [Next AI coding Tools](#/ai-coding-tools)",

This course exposes you to real-life tools Courses teach you programming and data science. From statistics to algorithms to writing Python code to building models. But one critical subject that’s rarely covered is: what tools should I pick and how do I become proficient in them? These tools might not help your CV much. But they will make things easier in real life. For example, at school: You learn from pristine datasets. But in the industry, you’ll have to scrape them yourself. You learn how to train models. But soon, you’ll just pick something from HuggingFace. You learn to write a log parser over weeks. Instead, your boss writes a sed + grep script in minutes. “We lost the documentation on quantum mechanics. You’ll have to decode the regexes yourself.” In this course, we’ve curated the most important tools people use in data science. Learn them well. You’ll be a lot more productive than your peers. This course is quite hard Here’s students’ feedback: It used to be an easy course until 2024. # # # Now it’s hard and covers more. Take it in your last semester if possible. # # # Plan extra time. It takes more time than typical 3-credit courses. # # # LLMs grade you – unpredictably. # # The ROE is hard. # Take Graded assignment 1 to check if you’re ready for this course. Please drop this course (do it in a later term) if you score low. It’ll be too tough for you now. Programming skills are a pre-requisite You need a good understanding of Python, JavaScript, HTML, HTTP, Excel, and data science concepts. But isn’t this a data science course? Yes. Good data scientists are good programmers. Data scientists don’t just analyze data or train models. They source data, clean it, transform it, visualize it, deploy it, and automate the whole process. In some organizations, some of this work is done by others (e.g. data engineers, IT teams, etc.). But wherever you are, some of the time, you need to write code for all of this yourself. This course teaches you tools that will make you more productive. But you do need programming to learn many of them. We encourage learning by sharing You CAN copy from friends. You can work in groups. You can share code. Even in projects, assignments, and exams (except the final end-term exam). Why should you copy? Because in real life, there’s no time to re-invent the wheel. You’ll be working in teams on the shoulders of giants. It’s important to learn how to do that well. To learn well, understand what you’re copying. If you’re short of time, prioritize. To learn better, teach what you’ve learnt.

It handles various formats (PNG, JPEG, GIF, etc.) and provides operations from basic resizing to complex filters. Here’s a minimal example showing common operations: ``` /// script requires-python = \">=3.11\" dependencies = [\"Pillow\"] /// from PIL import Image, ImageEnhance, ImageFilter async def process_image(path: str) -> Image.Image: \"\"\"Process an image with basic enhancements.\"\"\" with Image.open(path) as img: # Convert to RGB to ensure compatibility img = img.convert('RGB') # Resize maintaining aspect ratio img.thumbnail((800, 800)) # Apply enhancements img = (ImageEnhance.Contrast(img) .enhance(1.2)) return img.filter(ImageFilter.SHARPEN) if name == \" main \": import asyncio img = asyncio.run(process_image(\"input.jpg\")) img.save(\"output.jpg\", quality=85)Copy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` Key features and techniques you’ll learn: Image Loading and Saving : Handle various formats with automatic conversion Basic Operations : Resize, rotate, crop, and flip images Color Manipulation : Adjust brightness, contrast, and color balance Filters and Effects : Apply blur, sharpen, and other visual effects Drawing : Add text, shapes, and overlays to images Batch Processing : Handle multiple images efficiently Memory Management : Process large images without memory issues Basic Image Operations Common operations for resizing, cropping, and rotating images: ``` from PIL import Image async def transform_image( path: str, size: tuple[int, int], rotation: float = 0 ) -> Image.Image: \"\"\"Transform image with basic operations.\"\"\" with Image.open(path) as img: # Resize with anti-aliasing img = img.resize(size, Image.LANCZOS) # Rotate around center if rotation: img = img.rotate(rotation, expand=True) # Auto-crop empty edges img = img.crop(img.getbbox()) return imgCopy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` Color and Enhancement Adjust image appearance with built-in enhancement tools: ``` from PIL import ImageEnhance, ImageOps async def enhance_image( img: Image.Image, brightness: float = 1.0, contrast: float = 1.0, saturation: float = 1.0 ) -> Image.Image: \"\"\"Apply color enhancements to image.\"\"\" enhancers = [ (ImageEnhance.Brightness, brightness), (ImageEnhance.Contrast, contrast), (ImageEnhance.Color, saturation) ] for Enhancer, factor in enhancers: if factor != 1.0: img = Enhancer(img).enhance(factor) return imgCopy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` Filters and Effects Apply visual effects and filters to images: ``` from PIL import ImageFilter def apply_effects(img: Image.Image) -> Image.Image: \"\"\"Apply various filters and effects.\"\"\" effects = { 'blur': ImageFilter.GaussianBlur(radius=2), 'sharpen': ImageFilter.SHARPEN, 'edge': ImageFilter.FIND_EDGES, 'emboss': ImageFilter.EMBOSS } return {name: img.filter(effect) for name, effect in effects.items()}Copy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` Drawing and Text Add text, shapes, and overlays to images: ``` from PIL import Image, ImageDraw, ImageFont async def add_watermark( img: Image.Image, text: str, font_size: int = 30 ) -> Image.Image: \"\"\"Add text watermark to image.\"\"\" draw = ImageDraw.Draw(img) font = ImageFont.truetype(\"arial.ttf\", font_size) # Calculate text size and position text_bbox = draw.textbbox((0, 0), text, font=font) text_width = text_bbox[2] - text_bbox[0] text_height = text_bbox[3] - text_bbox[1] # Position text at bottom-right x = img.width - text_width - 10 y = img.height - text_height - 10 # Add text with shadow draw.text((x+2, y+2), text, font=font, fill='black') draw.text((x, y), text, font=font, fill='white') return imgCopy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` Memory-Efficient Processing Handle large images without loading them entirely into memory: ``` from PIL import Image import os async def process_large_images( input_dir: str, output_dir: str, max_size: tuple[int, int] ) -> None: \"\"\"Process multiple large images efficiently.\"\"\" os.makedirs(output_dir, exist_ok=True) for filename in os.listdir(input_dir): if not filename.lower().endswith(('.png', '.jpg', '.jpeg')): continue input_path = os.path.join(input_dir, filename) output_path = os.path.join(output_dir, filename) with Image.open(input_path) as img: # Process in chunks using thumbnail img.thumbnail(max_size) img.save(output_path, optimize=True)Copy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` Practice with these resources: Pillow Documentation : Complete API reference Python Image Processing Tutorial : In-depth guide Sample Images Dataset : Test images for practice Watch these tutorials for hands-on demonstrations: Image Processing with ImageMagick ImageMagick is a powerful command-line tool for image manipulation, offering features beyond what’s possible with Python libraries.

Or see garbage when you load a CSV file? This video explains why. It covers how computers store text (called character encoding) and why it sometimes goes wonky. Learn about ASCII (the original 7-bit encoding system that could only handle 128 characters), why that wasn’t enough for global languages, and how modern solutions like Unicode save the day by letting us use any character from any language. Some programs try to guess encodings (sometimes badly!). A signature called BOM (Byte Order Mark) helps computers know exactly how to read text files correctly. Learn how Unicode, UTF-8 and character encoding works. This is a common gotcha when building apps that handle international text - something bootcamps often skip but developers and data scientists regularly face in the real world. Unicode is fundamental for data scientists working with international data. Here are key concepts you need to understand: Character Encodings : Different ways to represent text in computers ASCII (7-bit): Limited to 128 characters, English-only UTF-8: Variable-width encoding, backwards compatible with ASCII UTF-16: Variable-width (2 or 4 bytes with surrogate pairs), used in Windows and Java UTF-32: Fixed-width encoding, memory inefficient but simple Common encoding issues you’ll encounter: ``` Reading files with explicit encoding with open('file.txt', encoding='utf-8') as f: text = f.read() Handling encoding errors import pandas as pd df = pd.read_csv('data.csv', encoding='utf-8', errors='replace') Detecting file encoding import chardet with open('unknown.txt', 'rb') as f: result = chardet.detect(f.read()) print(result['encoding'])Copy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` [Previous HTTP Requests: Curl, Postman](#/http-requests) [Next CSS Selectors](#/css-selectors)",

Use vector databases when your embeddings exceed available memory or when you want it run fast at scale. (This is important. If your code runs fast and fits in memory, you DON’T need a vector database. You can can use numpy for these tasks.) Vector databases are an evolving space. The first generation of vector databases were written in C and typically used an algorithm called HNSW (a way to approximately find the nearest neighbor). Some popular ones are: chroma 19,637 ⭐ May 2025 qdrant 23,341 ⭐ May 2025 lancedb 6,327 ⭐ May 2025 faiss 34,684 ⭐ May 2025 milvus 34,476 ⭐ May 2025 weaviate 13,222 ⭐ May 2025 In addition, most relational databases now support vector search.

This approach emerged from vibe coding , where you code as if code doesn’t exist. With vibe analysis, you give an LLM full context, state your goal, and review only the answers. The LLM handles exploration, cleaning, modeling, visualization, and deployment. Watch these comprehensive talks on vibe analysis and the changing role of data scientists: In this module, you’ll learn: Core vibe analysis workflow : From data to deployed insights without manual coding Automated exploration : Using LLMs to generate and test hypotheses Data quality automation : Detecting non-obvious issues and creating validation rules Visual storytelling : Building publication-ready data stories with style transfer Meta-prompting techniques : Improving prompts before execution The traditional data science workflow A data scientist typically: Explores the data (EDA, profiling, types, missing values) Cleans it (deduping, anomalies, schemas) Models it (features, algorithms, parameters) Explains it (narratives, visualizations, slides) Deploys it (APIs, dashboards, reports) Anonymizes it (synthetic data for case studies) Each step can take days or weeks. Vibe analysis automates most of this cycle. What’s dying vs what’s rising Tasks being automated EDA : Profiling, types, missing values, deduping, anomaly detection Scaffolds : Loaders, schemas, docstrings, README files, tests AutoML : Feature selection, model choice, parameter tuning, metrics Code writing : LLMs can fill in 80% from specifications Explainers : Generating narratives, visuals, presentations Forms : Project reports, timesheets, documentation Skills becoming critical Leadership : Setting the right goal and allocation across human and AI teams Problem framing : Precise prompts that reduce iteration cycles Eval design : Automated validation with binary checks and LLM-as-judge Invariants : Defining ontologies, declaring truths and constraints Verticalization : Domain-specific datasets and workflows as competitive moats Trust & taste : Auditing AI output, telling compelling stories Key insight : LLMs aren’t better than the best humans, but they’re better than average or worst performers in many areas. They can’t multiply 8-digit numbers, but they excel at language—and code is language. Automated hypothesis generation Instead of manually exploring data, use LLMs to generate business hypotheses automatically. Try HypoForge , a tool that: Uploads your dataset Generates business hypotheses based on column headers and sample data Writes code to test each hypothesis Runs statistical tests (correlation, significance) Reports which hypotheses the data supports Example prompt: ``` Dataset: India aviation traffic data Context: Naya Airlines wants to launch in India. How can they make money? Think like a greedy businessman. Generate hypotheses and test them.Copy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` Sample hypotheses generated: “Launch predominantly domestic point-to-point network targeting busiest metros” “Higher load factors during festival months (May)” “Focus on high per-capita routes” The tool tests each hypothesis statistically and reports results—green for supported, red for rejected. Rigor is for wimps. Let the LLM test everything in parallel. When done, have it craft an executive summary you can directly present. Vibe analysis workflow The complete workflow for vibe analysis: 1. Provide context Upload your dataset to ChatGPT , Claude , or Codex . Give it business context: I have aviation traffic data. Naya Airlines wants to launch in India. Their operations head needs to know: - Which cities will make the most money - Which routes will always be full - What prices people will happily payCopy to clipboardErrorCopied 2. Request comprehensive analysis Ask for specific analyses OR ask it to discover insights: ``` Perform analysis and generate insights. Include: Route leaderboard, growth, seasonality Network exploration with weighted edges and centrality Per-capita comparisons for fairness Carrier variation, entry/exit patterns Summarize insights as poetry for entertainment.Copy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` The LLM will: Write Pandas/NumPy code Run statistical tests Generate visualizations Create summaries Example output poetry: “Routes of gold, a leaderboard sings. Delhi to Mumbai, the crown that it brings. Hyderabad rises with traffic so bright. Growth curves soaring, a new city’s flight.” 3. Let it work autonomously Use Agent Full Access mode (in Codex or similar tools) to eliminate approval prompts. The agent runs autonomously, writing and executing code. Best practice : Run multiple agents in parallel—one for analysis, one for planning, one for visualization. This avoids waiting and context pollution. 4. Find non-obvious insights Have the LLM focus on surprising patterns: Find the most interesting, useful, and non-obvious insights from this data. Explain in simple, witty language for a senior exec.Copy to clipboardErrorCopied The LLM might discover: Hyderabad → Hyderabad is an active route (data error!) Cumulative drone certificates decrease some days (withdrawn certificates) June 7, 2023: 86K international arrivals exceeds global traffic (anomaly!) Dec 4, 2023: 894K footfalls vs 804K people—90K teleported? (data quality issue) Automated data quality checks Traditional data cleaning is painful. Automate it. Try SchemaForge , which: Uploads datasets (CSV, Excel, databases) Identifies column types, descriptions, PII, keys Detects data quality issues Generates DBT validation rules Creates a downloadable package to run checks Alternatively, use ChatGPT directly: ``` Perform COMPREHENSIVE and ADVANCED data quality analysis. For each dataset, list every clear and potential data quality issue. Make sure these are non-obvious, non-trivial, and mind-blowing! Suggest approaches to automatically fix these.Copy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` Example issues found: Active route from Hyderabad to Hyderabad Cumulative counts that decrease Traffic exceeding global totals Footfalls exceeding passenger counts Visual data stories Create beautiful, interactive visualizations styled after leading publications. Style transfer technique Instead of specifying every detail, reference a style: Create a beautiful visual data story as a single-page web app that explains these insights in the style of The New York Times.Copy to clipboardErrorCopied The LLM understands: New York Times = scrollytelling, clean typography, data-driven narratives South China Morning Post = interactive graphics, bold colors The Economist = minimal, chart-focused Key insight : Having a mental catalog of styles (developers, painters, publications) makes prompting far more efficient than explicit instructions. Generate and publish Complete workflow: Create a beautiful visual data story as a single-page web app that explains this insight in the style of The New York Times.Copy to clipboardErrorCopied The agent generates: index.html with the story style.css with styling script.js with interactions Preview locally: ``` python -m http.server Open http://localhost:8000Copy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` Publish to GitHub Pages: Create a new GitHub repo Upload the three files Go to Settings → Pages Select “main” branch → Save Visit https://username.github.io/repo-name/ You’ve now vibe analyzed, vibe coded, and vibe deployed . Creating synthetic data with hypotheses Don’t generate random fake data—it yields no insights. Instead, align synthetic data with business hypotheses. Prompt: ``` Generate realistic fake data for [domain] List columns and their distributions List 5 hypotheses about the data Generate 2,000 random rows that align with hypotheses in a statistically significant way Test each hypothesis to verify alignment Let me download as CSVCopy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` Example for airline data: Hypotheses generated : Monsoon months have higher delays Longer flights have higher base fares Holiday periods show higher load factors The LLM creates data where these patterns hold, making it useful for demos and case studies without exposing real data. Read more: How to fake data that tells a story Meta-prompting: improve prompts before execution Use LLMs to optimize your prompts before running analysis. This reduces confusion and increases single-shot success rates. Workflow: Write your initial prompt Add: “Suggest an improved prompt for this” Review the improved version Run the improved prompt in a fresh session Example transformation: Original prompt : Analyze this weekday vs weekend sales dataCopy to clipboardErrorCopied Improved prompt (generated by LLM): ``` You are a retail analytics expert working with Middle East sales data. Analyze weekday versus weekend sales patterns, considering: - Regional variations (Friday weekends in UAE vs Saturday-Sunday in other regions) - Seasonal effects and holidays - Per-store and per-category breakdowns - Statistical significance of observed differences Provide actionable recommendations with clear tradeoffs. Generate visualizations showing top/bottom performers and significant gaps.Copy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` The improved prompt is clearer, includes domain context, and specifies outputs. This dramatically increases the quality of results. Parallel chat strategy Don’t wait for agents to finish. Run multiple chats in parallel: Chat 1 : Main analysis and coding Chat 2 : “What interesting, useful analysis can I run on this dataset?” Chat 3 : “Find the most interesting, useful, non-obvious insights” While Chat 1 executes, Chats 2 and 3 provide planning and suggestions. When Chat 1 finishes, you have multiple perspectives and can choose the best path. Key principle : If you ask an LLM to plan and execute, it allocates less thinking to planning. Separate planning from execution for deeper thinking. Model selection and reasoning For visual aesthetics and complex analysis: GPT-5 (via Codex ): Set reasoning_effort to high for better structure Claude 3.5 Sonnet : Best aesthetics, strong at visual design Gemini 2.5 Pro : Good balance, web-based via Jules Configure in Codex config.toml : [models.gpt5] reasoning_effort = \"high\"Copy to clipboardErrorCopied Higher reasoning effort means more thoughtful outputs, especially for aesthetics and architecture. Error detection and validation Don’t trust LLM output blindly. Use multiple validation strategies. 1. Multi-model review Ask different models to find errors: Find errors in the analysis that generated this data visualization. Focus on numerical and statistical errors.Copy to clipboardErrorCopied Example errors caught: Division by zero when denominator is empty Frame latency of 44 minutes (impossible—likely timestamp vs frame rate confusion) Using peak/average without distribution analysis (omission error) Key insight : Many eyes make bugs shallow. Run multiple LLM “reviewers” as a sieve—each catches different flaws. 2. Checksum validation When generating summaries, ask the LLM to: Break down into categories with totals. Verify as you go along. Create a checksum list.Copy to clipboardErrorCopied This forces the LLM to validate its own work during generation. 3. Post-validation prompts After analysis, ask: Review this analysis for: - Numerical errors - Statistical errors - Missing considerations - Impossible values - Data quality issuesCopy to clipboardErrorCopied Making analysis repeatable Once you have good results, convert the analysis into repeatable code. Create an analysis.py file that will recreate this analysis and generate an XLSX file with required data.Copy to clipboardErrorCopied Why create a script? Consistency : Re-run the same analysis weekly with new data Verification : Multiple LLMs can review the code for errors Transparency : Stakeholders see exactly what was calculated Testing : Add unit tests to catch regressions The script is a byproduct, not the primary product. You analyze first, then extract code. Context management and session hygiene Reset over repair Long conversations accumulate bad assumptions (“context rot”). When errors compound: Start a fresh chat with a clean prompt Save working code before attempting modifications Keep changes small and independently verifiable If a fix doesn’t land in one pass, reset rather than iterate through broken context. Summarize and restart After a long session with multiple corrections: Given this conversation, give me one prompt that will do the equivalent of all we have done so far.Copy to clipboardErrorCopied Use this condensed prompt to start fresh, avoiding accumulated errors. Meta-analysis: analyzing your analysis LLMs log all actions. Review logs to improve your workflow. Tools: Codex logs : Stored in ~/.codex/sessions/YYYY-MM-DD/ Log parser : Convert JSONL logs to readable markdown Example: tools-in-data-science/codex-log-parser (fictional link—build your own) Review patterns: What questions do you ask most? What does the LLM do well? Where does it stall or fail? Could different libraries help? Should you delegate certain tasks differently? Meta-analysis is analyzing your analysis process to continuously improve prompts, tools, and workflows. Risk mitigation strategies Three layers of protection when shipping LLM insights to executives: 1. Frame safe questions Ask questions that can’t go wrong: General business recommendations : LLMs excel at business strategy language Options with tradeoffs : “Here are 3 approaches with pros/cons” Directional insights : “Traffic is increasing in these regions” vs precise numbers 2. Reduce error likelihood Structure prompts to minimize mistakes: Write code first, then analyze (code is reviewable) Add citations: “Include row numbers for each insight” Request checksums: “Provide category totals that sum to overall total” Verify as you go: “After each",

Vibe coding is different from AI coding. It’s “fully giving in to the vibes…” and “forgetting that the code even exists”, i.e., accept-all edits, don’t hand-edit diffs, etc. The goal is to get to a working prototype as fast as possible. Ship scrappy first drafts fast : Focus on getting a working version quickly rather than polished code. AI can generate functional prototypes in minutes, allowing you to validate ideas before investing in refinement. Then tighten with deterministic gates : Once you have a working prototype, add proper testing, code review, and quality assurance. This hybrid approach combines AI’s speed with traditional software engineering rigor. Embrace the iteration loop : AI coding tools excel at making incremental changes. Use this to your advantage by continuously refining your application through conversational editing. This mindset shift recognizes that AI tools are best at getting you 80% of the way quickly, while human expertise and systematic processes handle the final 20% that ensures production quality. Vibe-coding is not suitable for all scenarios. It works best for prototypes, internal tools, and projects where speed is prioritized over perfection. For mission-critical systems, a more cautious approach is warranted. AI coding safety AI coding tools can introduce security risks if not used carefully. Here are some best practices to ensure safe usage: Isolate tools in sandboxes : Run AI-generated code in containerized environments or dedicated virtual machines. This prevents malicious code from accessing your main system or sensitive data. Use MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers : Implement MCP servers to create controlled interfaces between AI models and your tools. This provides a secure boundary for tool access and execution. Redact secrets and sensitive data : Never include API keys, passwords, or personal information in prompts. Use environment variables and secure storage for credentials. Treat repository content as untrusted : Any README.md, HTML files, or documentation in repositories could contain prompt injection attacks. Review content before processing with AI tools. Require human approval for privileged actions : Implement confirmation steps for file deletion, system changes, or deployment operations. Never allow AI tools to perform destructive actions automatically. Limit web navigation and shell access : Use allowlists for external URLs and shell commands. Restrict AI tools to only necessary domains and safe command sets. Review tool execution plans : Before allowing AI tools to execute complex workflows, review their planned actions. Many tools now provide execution previews for this purpose. Recent security research has identified vulnerabilities in AI coding assistants, including prompt injection through repository content and arbitrary code execution risks. Stay informed about these issues through security advisories. Google Gemini CLI prompt injection vulnerability Code execution through deception in AI CLI tools Anthropic output styles and safety practices Implementing these safety practices ensures that AI coding tools enhance your productivity without compromising security or introducing unnecessary risks to your development environment.

How to make bar chart race in PowerPoint Source: How to make a bar chart race in PowerPoint Flourish made bar chart races easy to create. That sparked a data visualization meme with hundreds of bar chart races like these going viral. A Flourish data visualization With PowerPoint’s morph transition , it’s now possible to make a bar chart race in PowerPoint, too. Here’s an example. Step-by-step guide to make Bar Chart Race in PowerPoint Here’s a quick walk-through of the techniques we used to create this. Step 1: Create a 2-slide bar chart race To create the animation, create two slides. In the first, add one rectangle per bar in the bar chart. Copy the slide to the second one, and move or re-size the bars. The result could look like this. Under Transition, choose “Morph”. Pick a duration. When you view it slideshow mode, this is what it looks like. PowerPoint moves objects based on the text in the bar chart. You can add images. These will be moved too. Colors will be smoothly morphed. Download this Bar Chart Race PPTX to try it out Step 2: Size the bars accurately The reason we can’t just use a bar chart is that PowerPoint can’t morph bar charts. So the (painful) alternative is to manually create the bars. A quick way is to scale the numbers by a convenient factor. For example, if Samuel Jackson’s box office gross is $6.5 billion, you can select the Shape Format and set the width to 6.5″. (You can select all the bars and scale them later.) Create the Star Wars Intro Crawl The ShapeChef blog has a step-by-step guide on How to Create a Star Wars Intro Crawl . This uses WordArt styles and 3D rotation to create something that mimics the Star Wars intro crawl. Step 3: Record voiceover PowerPoint’s Insert > Media > Audio > Record Audio… feature lets you record your voice and insert it into the slide directly . You can use Playback controls to trim the audio and fade in or out. I wrote down the script for each year and inserted the audio on every slide. Step 4: Auto-play the voiceover Select the Start: “Automatically” option. This plays the audio as soon as the slide starts. To advance the slides automatically, select the Transition > Timing > Advance Slide > After option, and set it to zero . This will move to the next slide after all the animations (including audio) on the page are complete. Step 5: Add background music You can find background music at YouTube’s Audio Library , SoundCloud , Jamendo , etc. Download the audio, insert it in your first slide. Check Playback > Audio Options > Play across Slides. That will play the music in the background. (Reduce the volume, so that it’s not intrusive.) Step 6: Export as MPEG-4 PowerPoint can save as MPEG-4 video . For some reason, though, the output was jittery. So for my final version , I used Open Broadcaster Software (OBS) instead and recorded the screen. 99% perspiration These techniques were quick to find. But the bulk of the time went into: Crafting an interesting story to tell — which included the titles, and finding the movies to support the title Settings the widths on every single one of the 40 slides Adding the photos against every bar and movie posters on every slide Adding animations against every movie poster Recording the voice-over on every slide All-in-all, a fairly manual effort. For deployment, the automated scrolly-telling approach “ Box Office Mojo ” created by Pratap works much better. But we chose the manual approach consciously . While prototyping, it allowed us to change course mid-way easily.

Here’s another version of this analysis, delivered as part of a talk: Transcript Data visualization can be a great way of exploring data, and Excel is actually a pretty fantastic tool to be able to do that. What I’ll be showing you in this session is how you can create simple visualizations in Excel to explore time series data and use that to find meaningful insights about the data itself. Let’s start with this data. What we have is data about a series of securities. That includes currencies like the Australian Dollar, the Canadian Dollar, the Swiss Franc, and so on, as well as some indices, like the FTSE, the S&P, and the NASDAQ. This apart, we also have some commodities, like the price of gold or the price of silver, or the price of gold, or the price of platinum. This information, that is, the values for each of these securities, we have for a period ranging from August—that’s somewhere around the 8th of August—all the way down to the 6th of September, which is a one-quarter, 90-day period. Now, what might we want to see from all of this information? Well, one thing we might be curious about is what’s the trend? How is the Australian dollar going? How is NASDAQ trending, and so on? We may also want to see whether the value tomorrow is likely to be higher or lower. Which of these has a higher value today? Which of these fluctuates more? These are examples of questions that we may want answered. And the way in which we might answer them is potentially through a visualization that might look something like this. Let’s zoom in. We have for each of these securities—let’s say the FTSE, the S&P, etc.—a sense of what the trend looks like. So, the FTSE looks like it dipped, rose, dipped again, and rose even further, which is almost exactly the same trend as the S&P and the NASDAQ, and is very similar to the trend exhibited by the Australian dollar as well. But it is slightly different from the Brazilian Real and is certainly different from something like the Hong Kong dollar, which seems to have a much more pronounced, discrete trend, or the Israeli Kroner, which has a very different pattern as well. From this, we can see that the indices seem to be going fairly similarly, but the currencies are, though somewhat close, still fairly different from each other, and we can infer what the pattern is from those. We can also see that the Israeli Kroner is probably one of the very few that is actually dipping rather than rising compared to the others. We can also see what the average values of these indices or the exchange rates are. We can see how much they are likely to grow the next day—effectively a forecast. From this, we can quickly infer that the Brazilian Real is what’s forecast to grow the most tomorrow. And also from their variance as a percentage, we can see that the Brazilian Real also has had the highest percentage fluctuation. The Indian Rupee has also had a fairly high fluctuation but is not expected to grow as much tomorrow. The range tells us another measure of fluctuation, which is the spread between the highest and the lowest values as a percentage. And we can see that the Brazilian Real has had a 6% spread. The NASDAQ has fluctuated by as much as 5%, but the Hong Kong Dollar is barely fluctuating at 0.04%. How does one create a visual like this? We’ll start by creating a pivot table. So let’s select this data range, click on Insert, PivotTable from this table or range. And for the selection that we have, it says I can create it in a new worksheet or an existing one. Let’s create it in a new worksheet. Now, what I want is for each of the securities, for each of the dates that we have—it says I already have a pivot table on this, do I want to replace it? No, I don’t want to replace it. Now, this has condensed the dates into months by adding a months column and under that, dates. I don’t really want to collapse it; I just want to see all the dates at one shot. And now I can get the rates for the individual dates. So now this gives me for each security, for each date, what the value is. This allows me to start putting in a variety of trends. So, let’s start by adding a new column here. We’ll call this column “Security” and we’ll put in the values same as, let’s say, cell C5. That’s FTSE, and we’ll extend the selection from here all the way down to the bottom. Let’s get rid of the grand totals; we don’t really need those. Those don’t have a meaning. We’ll remove the grand totals here, and we’ll remove the grand totals here. Right-click, remove grand total. All right. Now, let’s add a column for the trend. And we’ll call that column “Trend”. The way to insert this is using the Insert menu and the sparkline called “Line,” where we can pick any data range, such as from 8th of August for the FTSE all the way to the 6th of November. And that automatically inserts a sparkline. You can expand the cell and the sparkline fills the entire range, and this can now be extended all the way down to the last row, which fills all of these trend lines automatically, and you can make inferences about how these are moving. So you can see that platinum, for example, seems to have had a slightly bigger dip than silver has had. We can also look at the average value. So that’s simply equals average of the data over this entire range. So we start with, let’s say, this is cell G5 all the way down to the end, which would be CS5. Looks like I made a slight mistake in that formula. So, yeah, there we go. Now that we have this, it can again be extended all the way down to the bottom, and we’ll have the average values for each of these. We can decide how exactly we want to format these cells depending on the actual numbers. We can also predict what the value is going to be. So let’s call that “Forecast,” for which we can use a formula called GROWTH . This takes three things: the growth formula requires a set of known Y values (that is, these values) and a set of known X values, which are kind of like the dates, and the new value for which we want to predict. So let’s fill those in. What I’m going to do is take these dates’ values and convert them into numbers. So this can be formatted as a number that is the number of days since the 1st of January, 1980, and you’ll see that it increases by one for every successive date. So we can go all the way to the end and then take this data and then say for the next available date, that is the 7th of November, that’s simply this value plus one. And we want to predict for this as an X value. So let’s do that. Equals GROWTH of the known Y values, which is simply the currency values, against the known X values, which is simply these values. And I’m going to press F4 to add a dollar against the formula so that when we copy-paste this down, these numbers don’t change. And that leaves us with the value that we want to predict, which is this particular value. So that’s predicting that the Australian dollar is going to be 0.96. Okay, but how much higher is that than the previous day? So let’s put in the value of the last day. To look at the growth, that’s going to be a bit over 1%, say 1.5% higher than the last day’s value. That’s the forecast for the next date. Let’s take this all the way down and we can see which of these securities is going to increase or decrease. We, unfortunately, aren’t able to do this for missing values, and since the FTSE, S&P, and the NASDAQ have weekends that don’t have values, we can’t use the growth formula. But for the rest, we can do this and apply a conditional formatting that gives us a color scale that tells us which of these values, in this case, the Brazilian Real, is going to be the one with the highest increase. We can then similarly add one for what’s the variation. So let’s take the standard deviation of the same data, starting from here all the way down to the end. And that gives us what’s the standard deviation. But rather than have this as an absolute number, it’s probably better to divide this by the mean so that we get the deviation, the variance as a percentage of the mean. And that’s slightly more informative. It says this varies plus or minus a certain percentage. And again, with a certain amount of conditional formatting, what we’ll be able to do is see where the variation is higher. If you’re not comfortable with standard deviation, then you could just use min and max instead and see how much the spread of the value is. But if there are outliers, if there are very high and very low values, then you’re probably better off with something which does a little bit of outlier removal. But what we have right now is a quick sense of how each of these securities are performing. And you can think of that as the first level of exploratory visualization of this data. Now that we have this, another exploration you may want to do is, how do these securities move with each other? So, for instance, it looks like when the Australian dollar is moving up, the Brazilian Real is also kind of moving up. But how close are they? And it doesn’t look like the Canadian dollar is that close. So can we actually get a quantitative measure or an intuitive feel for how close these move together? Well, that’s the next level of visualization where we could take, for example, the correlation between the Australian dollar and the Brazilian Real and see how they tend to move together.",

Well, that’s the next level of visualization where we could take, for example, the correlation between the Australian dollar and the Brazilian Real and see how they tend to move together. And we find that the pattern’s pretty close. In fact, we see that about 82%, or 83% almost, of the variation in the Brazilian Real is explainable by the Australian dollar’s movement. That’s pretty strong. But if I take the Canadian dollar, now we are taking the X-axis to be the Australian dollar. How much of the Australian dollar’s movement can explain the Canadian dollar’s movement? The answer is only about 26%. Not so strong. Now this is not exactly a perfect pattern. What about the Swiss Franc? 60%, slightly closer. So I can quantitatively say that the Australian dollar is actually slightly closer to the Swiss Franc than to the Canadian dollar. And we can keep moving these and figuring out. At 85%, the Chinese Yuan is even closer, closely determined by the Australian dollar. And we can look at any pair of currencies to see how well they are related. So, how do we create this kind of a visualization? How do we also use this to spot the outliers? What are the specific points when we actually had an unusually high or an unusually low value? Well, all it takes is, pick a column, let’s say the Australian dollar in this case. We want to find the influence of the Australian dollar on, pick another column, let’s say the Swiss Franc. Now, go to Insert and click a scatter plot. That gives you the scatter plot right away, and it tells you that it’s the CHF that you’re predicting, but let’s ignore that for now. The next thing that you can do is right-click and add a trendline. A trendline can be linear, logarithmic, exponential, and so on. In this particular case, we’ll assume that we want a linear trendline. The variations are pretty small. And you can also add an equation and the R-square to this, which you can move around and format any way you like. So, now we can do exactly the same thing that we did before, which is change any of the values and see how well one particular currency is able to predict the value of another currency. This gives us a good feel, therefore, for which of these currencies have a strong correlation or regression, that is, what is the strength of the impact of one on the other. But it would be good if I could just get the number without having to make this movement, which takes us to the next level of abstraction. Where, if I could just put in, for example, the slope or even the correlation coefficient. Let’s just say I want the correlation coefficient of, let’s make it a bit bigger, the Brazilian Real against the Australian dollar. So that’s equals correlation of, take all the values of the Brazilian Real against the Australian dollar. So that says 91% correlated. Great. What if I wanted to do this for the Canadian dollar? That’s 54%. That’s a lot less. This is 51% Canadian dollar against the Australian dollar, and this is 78% Swiss Franc against the Australian dollar, and so on. And I can quickly see that so far, in fact, let’s add a conditional formatting around this to see which is the most correlated with the Australian dollar. It looks like at 92%, the Chinese Yuan, no, sorry, the Singaporean dollar is closest to the Australian dollar. Or no, sorry, I missed the New Zealand dollar. The New Zealand dollar is the closest to the Australian dollar with a 95% correlation. Now, we got these values. What if we could get these values for any pair of currencies? I just have these for the Australian dollar. What if we could do this for any pair of currencies? Well, that you can do using a correlation matrix, and that’s what this shows. So if I take, for example, the Canadian dollar versus, let’s say, the Brazilian Real, that’s a 54% correlation. If I take the Hong Kong dollar versus, let’s say, the Chinese Yuan, that’s a 57% correlation. Now, from this, I can, with the color coding, see a few things. Wherever it’s red, the correlations are low or even negative. So the Pakistani Rupee, for example, seems to be anti-correlated with most securities , but moderately positively correlated with gold, silver, and platinum. We also see that the Israeli Kroner is not very strongly positively correlated with most securities, though it is fairly strongly positively correlated with the Pakistani Rupee here. So using a table like this, what we are able to do is figure out which securities move well with each other. To apply correlations, you need the Data Analysis ToolPak, which you’ll find in the Data menu out here under Analysis, called Data Analysis. If you don’t find it, then you may want to go to the File menu, Options, and look for Add-ins. And in the Add-ins section, make sure that you have the Analysis ToolPak Excel add-in inserted. If that’s not available, not possible, or you’re using a version of Excel that just does not have it, not a problem. You can still apply the correlation formula manually, the way we just did here, and do it for all of the securities. But if you have the Analysis ToolPak, what I’m about to show you becomes a whole lot easier. So you click on Data Analysis and choose Correlation. There are several other kinds of analysis that you can do, but you choose Correlation, click OK. And the input range that we select will be, well, effectively the same data that we have here, each of the values as columns. And then we say labels are present in the first row, because they are present in the first row, and the data is grouped as columns, not rows. That’s how we have structured the data. And the output is going to go into a new worksheet. Click OK, and that gives us exactly the same data that we looked at earlier. What we’ll do is change these values, rather than numbers, to percentages, and that makes it a little easier to see. We’ll also apply a conditional formatting to this, and that can be a red-amber-green kind of structure. And we have exactly the same visual that we had before. So, to summarize, what we did was took the underlying raw data. We then converted it to a set of exploratory visuals at the next level, which helped us see what the trends were and what the value is likely to be. We then started looking for patterns within these to see whether one particular security was more correlated with another. And we looked at which were securities that were most correlated, which were some of the outliers using scatter plots. And then we took it to the next level and started looking at whether there are patterns of correlations themselves, using a correlation matrix to see whether there are some securities that are consistently anti-correlated with others, like the Pakistani Rupee or the Israeli Kroner, and whether there are some securities that are very highly correlated with each other, like the Singapore dollar and the Malaysian Ringgit, or the Australian dollar and the New Zealand dollar, both of which happen to be neighbors in this particular case. Where I want to take this is that Excel in itself is a very powerful tool for exploratory analysis and exploratory visualization. And you can take datasets like this time series data and create some fairly powerful insights just from that. [Previous Interactive Notebooks: Marimo](#/marimo) [Next RAWgraphs](#/rawgraphs)",

You’ll learn that it’s applicable beyond social analysis to any scenario involving relationships between entities . Social Network Analysis : How Kumu facilitates social network analysis , helping to understand how different people and communities are connected, and identifying common interests. Data Preparation for Kumu : The process of preparing raw data, specifically IMDb actor data for Indian movies , to be uploaded to Kumu. This includes filtering for only movies and Indian movies. Creating Actor Networks : How to construct an actor collaboration matrix where each element denotes the number of movies two actors have acted in together. This involves a method using matrix multiplication of a movie-actor matrix with its transpose. Optimizing Sparse Matrices : Understanding that actor collaboration matrices are often sparse (contain many zero entries) and how to make computations fast and memory-efficient using the compressed sparse row (CSR) format from the scipy library in Python. Preparing Data for Kumu Upload : How to convert the processed matrix data into the “from node to node” format, along with the strength of the connection (number of shared movies), which is required for Kumu. Filtering Data Effectively : Filtering by Year : How to filter movie data by release year (e.g., movies released after 1950) by converting the ‘start year’ column to an integer data type, and troubleshooting common issues like newline characters ( /n ) within string data. Filtering by Language/Region : How to filter for specific regions or languages, such as Indian movies , by applying language options within data processing functions or by filtering a dedicated region data frame. Filtering Actor Pairs : How to reduce the data size by filtering for actors who have acted in a minimum number of movies and for actor pairs who have acted together in a minimum number of movies. Visualizing and Analyzing Networks in Kumu : How the prepared data creates a network of actors in Kumu , allowing you to observe clusters and understand direct and indirect connections. Exploring Network Connections : How to search for specific actors (e.g., Mohanlal) and examine their direct connections (e.g., Mohanlal and Saikumar acted in 8 movies) and indirect connections within the network. Introduction to Community Detection : A brief mention of community detection as a method to identify groups within the network and understand their interconnections, to be explored in other tutorials. General Data Science Practices : The importance of using resources like Google and documentation for problem-solving, even for seemingly simple tasks, and the necessity of ensuring correct data types for operations.

    "text": "Topic: Bonus Marks in TDS for Jan 25 Post #1: @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini Greetings sir! Sir, I have a query about the criteria for earning bonus marks in the TDS course. I’ve noticed that some students who completed GA7 are receiving bonus marks for extra peer reviews (5 bonus marks is quite significant as it improves grades as well). However, what about those of us who completed all 6 assignments but missed GA7 for some reason? As the course is quite challenging due to the vast syllabus, bonus marks would be really helpful for many of us. Could you kindly clarify the situation? Thank you and Regards Akshit --- Post #2: Yes, I also missed the same assignment due to pressure from other courses. However, awarding a 5-mark bonus instead of a percentile-based system like GA4 seems quite different. Is this information available to everyone @carlton sir? --- Post #3: Hello @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini @s.anand sir, I hope you are doing well. As per the grading document, we were informed that only the best 4 out of the 7 assessments would be considered for grading. However, there was no mention of bonus marks, and before the deadline, we were not informed about the +5 bonus marks for GA7. Due to other academic commitments, such as Project 2, some of us were unable to complete GA7. Now, we have come to know that some of our peers have received an email stating that they have been awarded +5 bonus marks, which directly contribute to the final score. In some cases, this may even impact the final grade. Since this information was not communicated earlier, we kindly request you to consider providing an alternative way for those who missed GA7 to earn these bonus marks—perhaps through reviewing submissions or another form of assessment. We sincerely request your understanding on this matter and would be grateful if you could provide an opportunity for us to earn the bonus marks as well. Looking forward to your kind consideration. Best regards, Digvijaysinh Chudasama --- Post #4: The Same happened to me. They should have informed this before. --- Post #5: Hello @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini @s.anand sir, I hope you are doing well.

Best regards, HARSH JAYSWAL --- Post #6: @s.anand @carlton same happens for me also sir plz look into this matter. --- Post #7: @carlton @s.anand There seems to be a sudden and unannounced change in the GA marking scheme, which feels quite arbitrary. Initially, we were told that GA would carry 15% weight, calculated as the best 4 out of 7. Based on this, after scoring full marks in four GAs, I didn’t attempt the rest. Even then, I did complete GA5 and GA6, which you can verify. Now I’m seeing in groups that there’s an “extra benefit” being given for GA7. If any changes are being made to the evaluation criteria, they should be communicated clearly via email or discourse. Transparency is important, and as students, we have the right to be informed about such decisions in advance. I could point out several other issues, but to keep it brief — grading should be fair and consistent. Every student deserves an equal opportunity, and if GA7 is being considered differently, everyone should have the chance to attempt or review it accordingly. @carlton, we request you to kindly consider this matter. We are looking forward to a quick response — hopefully one that ensures fairness for all students. --- Post #8: @carlton sir , This would be a deviation from the grading format right sir? As some of us were proactive and closed the 4 GA requirement earlier, if such extra weightage is given to a certain GA unannounced then how is it fair on the other students ? Kindly consider --- Post #9: same for me also … Please consider all the GA for the calculation and give bonus based on the overall performance in GA’s instead of one GA. @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini --- Post #10: Exactly! This should have been informed beforehand. It’s really unfair --- Post #11: It the team wants to give bonus marks then why specifically to peer review week-7 ? Like all the GAs were equally important ! So please do something about this. --- Post #12: @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini @s.anand I have completed 5 GAs, but missed others due to the time commitment required, along with managing three other subjects and one project. I kindly request that 5 bonus marks be awarded to all, as the additional marks for GA were not communicated earlier. This could result in a disadvantage for those of us who were unaware of the extra marks for GA7. Thank you for considering this. Regards: Akash --- Post #13: @carlton I genuinely wish I could respond more humbly, but the way this has unfolded makes it hard — and sadly, I’m not MSD to handle it all with silence and a smile. --- Post #16: Good evening @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini @s.anand Sir, I hope you are well According to the grading document, we were told that only the best 4 out of the 7 assessments would count towards our final grade. There was no mention of any bonus marks, and we were not informed about the +5 bonus marks for GA7 before the deadline. Because of other academic commitments like Project 2, some of us couldn’t complete GA7. Recently, we found out that some students received an email saying they’ve been given +5 bonus marks for GA7, which directly affects their final score and possibly their overall grade. Since this information wasn’t shared earlier, we kindly request you to consider offering an alternative way for those who missed GA7 to earn the bonus marks. This could be through a submission review or another form of assessment. We genuinely hope for your understanding and would be very grateful if you could provide a chance for us to earn the bonus marks too. Best regards, Palaash V.

Every student deserves an equal opportunity, and if GA7 is being considered differently, everyone should have the chance to attempt or review it accordingly. @carlton sir please look into this --- Post #18: @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini Yes sir , we have completed all the previous ga but not able to do week 7 , we feel that the bonus should be given to all on the basis of ga and not only on week 7 . Or it should have been informed earlier if such bonus was to be given . Please do consider our request . Thank you --- Post #19: Exactly , They have to informed this earlier , that week 7 have peer marks too , and now bonus too in the grading doc , they removed peer marks , so i thought it was removed , but its not --- Post #20: @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini @s.anand The sudden introduction of bonus marks for GA7 in Tools in Data Science has left many students confused, as there was no prior intimation regarding this change. We had all planned our submissions based on the clearly communicated “best 4 out of 7” policy. This unexpected shift has raised concerns about transparency and fairness principles that should be central to academic assessment. Fairness is not a privilege to be selectively granted; it is a fundamental right for every student. We respectfully urge the course coordinators to offer clarification and ensure that all students are evaluated on an equal footing. We hope the final grading reflects both justice and academic integrity. --- Post #21: @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini @s.anand Yes Sir, I also completed 6 GAs even tho it was written only best 4 out of 7 GAs would be considered for final grade, but couldn’t complete GA 7 due to pressure of other subjects, if it was written in the grading document I would have done it, hoping you would understand Sir, Please do consider our request. Thank you --- Post #22: @carlton sir in the grading document it was mentioned best 4 out of 7 assignments but I did 6 GAs but skipped GA7 due to other assignments and projects but now we got to know that 5 bonus marks are given in ga 7 which seems unfair to all of us as mostly people who did GA7 are the one who were not able to complete previous GAs so giving bonus for the last day give them a edge If it was announced before deadline of GA 7 it was okay and good for us to improve our grade but now it seems quite unfair so, please come with the best possible solution for this Thanking you waiting for your answer",

But the team has decided that we cannot allow students to make changes to their repos. Because someone else might have another minor issue they want to fix. We have to apply the rule uniformly. Unfortunately we cannot allow submissions that fail the prerequisites. Changing it now will not suddenly make it eligible. These things do matter when done at scale. Its an important lesson Anand wants students to understand. These “minor” things matter. Its a bit like assembling a rocket and forgetting the checklist for the pilot. Minor detail, costs Rs 2, but the rocket cannot leave without it. We had a significant discussion about it internally. For the sake of fairness to everyone who got it right, we cannot allow edits after the Project deadline. It makes the prerequisites meaningless, especially when it was clearly stressed upon in the sessions and the Project page. I know you will feel very disappointed but it is the decision the team has made and I have shared the reasons why. Kindest regards --- Post #7: Sir, Thankyou for your prompt reply to my query. I wanted to let you know that i had made change of ‘LICENSE’ to ‘MIT LICENSE’ on the 16th of Feb itself as that was the day that i had received the mail and because I saw that the submission date had been extended by one day(i.e the 16th of Feb itself). I completely understand what you are trying to convey but that was the sole reason i made that change on the 16th. I completely respect your decision but if there is even a slight possibility that you consider it (only because I did it on the 16th) I would highly appreciate it. Thankyou! --- Post #8: One thing we are doing is looking at the latest commit before the 18th of Feb. So if it was correct before the 18th of Feb then we will consider it and evaluate it, but it has to be precisely what is expected. If so, then your submission will be evaluated by building the image from the docker manifest in the github present at the version before the 18th. --- Post #9: Well noted sir.

So the main question is how do you test if the script will run according to the evaluation? The whole point is for it to run not just on your system. It should be deployable anywhere on any machine. Your solution should work anywhere we test it. Thats why you package it in a docker container. How you achieve that is up to you. But if we cannot run your docker container according to the specification we have provided then it has failed this crucial test.

    "text": "Topic: Concerns Regarding Various Issues: Graded Assignments, Project Doubts, and ROE Score Updates Post #1: @s.anand @carlton @Jivraj Dear TDS Team, I hope you are doing well. I am writing to highlight several issues and doubts related to different aspects of the course that require clarification and resolution. 1. Graded Assignments (GA) GA6 Doubts Unresolved: While doubts related to Q1 and Q2 have been addressed, other queries remain unresolved despite being posted in the GA6 thread . The deadline has passed, but no solutions have been provided. (Thread link) GA Platform Changes: Initially, we were solving questions on exam.sanand.workers.dev . However, in GA6, we moved to Seek and in GA7, to Google Forms. The issue is that in GA6, we cannot check our answers like we could in previous assignments. 2. Project Updates Project 1: The result is still awaited, although it was expected on or before March 16. Any update on this would be helpful. Project 2: There are multiple doubts posted in the Project 2 discussion thread, but they have not been addressed yet. Without these clarifications, it is difficult to proceed with the project. Could you please provide an expected timeline for when these queries will be resolved? (thread link) 3. ROE Score Update While ROE scores may not be a primary concern, the bonus marks in ROE have still not been updated on the student dashboard. It would be helpful to get confirmation on when these will be reflected. I appreciate your time and assistance in addressing these concerns. Looking forward to your response. Best regards, Lakshay --- Post #2: tigertds212×148 6.99 KB @carlton It’s been over a month, and now an extra day has been taken as well—when will TDS Project 1 finally be released? The delay is getting excessive; some clarity on the timeline would be appreciated. --- Post #3: lakshaygarg654: GA Platform Changes: Initially, we were solving questions on exam.sanand.workers.dev . However, in GA6, we moved to Seek and in GA7, to Google Forms. The issue is that in GA6, we cannot check our answers like we could in previous assignments. The course is in transition. Initially all of it used to be on seek portal. But there were limitations of seek portal that we were not able to work around to deliver the kind of interactive, reactive and rapid corrections/iterations that are now possible because we moved the evaluations from the seek portal to the TDS server. Since the move to the new TDS server on the back end, we are able to also directly see students actual parameterised questions whenever doubts are raised. This is NOT possible on seek portal for us. The results are immediate to see. You got timely rapid feedback for GA 1 to GA 5 from the TAs. The TAs were also able to iterate quickly in discussion with the instructors and the professor as well as operations. With GA 6 our inability to actually see your individual question sets immediately (its possible, but it has to take a very circuitous route via 3 set of people) meant we were always on the back foot for both, checking the answers, as well as making any corrections. And since the questions were parameterised, for technical reasons it was extremely cumbersome/risky/impossible to make changes without it being VERY disruptive to all students. These were some of the reasons we are transitioning. We have seen this problem term after term in prior terms with regards to the seek portal. This is a technological limitation of the current seek portal that directly impacts our ability to react to a dynamic course like TDS. GA 7 was decided to submit via forms again for the reasons listed above. GA6 was straightforward because it was a traditional evaluation. Whereas GA7 is once again very unique and does not handle well in being configured in Seek Portal. Since it was not possible in such a short time to transition GA7 to our preferred hosting server and student favourite, we opted for the least disruptive solution that we are able to action very quickly upon. lakshaygarg654: Project 1: The result is still awaited, although it was expected on or before March 16. Any update on this would be helpful. Project 1 evaluations is VERY computationally intensive for us to evaluate. Each project although dockerised, with an average submission weighing at 2GB, we have to provision space of 1 TB along with the cloud computer resources for all of that (RAM and vCPUs) and if you thought creating project 1 was tough, you can imagine the technical challenge involved in evaluating the 600+ submissions with all the errors and issues we have to fix. In truth its all hands on deck for us here on the back end because it has been deemed critical. So while we are moving the course along, we are also aware that evaluations are at serious risk of missing crucial deadlines. We are taking the matter with utmost seriousness. Its just that we cant always keep you up to date on every set back we are facing. Each and everyone of us are concerned about Project 1 and are working on it. Anand, JK, Prasanna, myself, Jivraj and Saransh. We all have been given access to the eval server which we only managed to provision a few days ago and we are all trying to get the most ambitious TDS project evaluation out the dry dock and into the water and hoping it floats gracefully rather than sink in the estuary. Meanwhile we are busy patching the pipes in the belly of the ship while its rolling down the slipway. lakshaygarg654: 3. ROE Score Update While ROE scores may not be a primary concern, the bonus marks in ROE have still not been updated on the student dashboard. It would be helpful to get confirmation on when these will be reflected. You got the maximum possible mark in ROE. Does it not show you got 100 in ROE in the dashboard? I have been told by operations that it has been pushed. Kind regards --- Post #4: We do not know yet. Please read reply to the original poster. Thanks, Kind regards --- Post #5: Thank you for your response @carlton and for addressing our concerns. We appreciate the efforts of the entire team in ensuring a smooth transition and improving the course experience. The reason for raising this separate post is that multiple doubts related to the course have been left unanswered over the past few days. Even if the course team provides a response without an immediate resolution, it would help us understand the ongoing process and what to expect next. We will wait for the resolution of GA6 issues and the release of Project 1 results. Regarding ROE, we initially assumed that marks would be awarded in the same manner as GA4 (110/100); however, now that you have clarified the maximum marks is 100. Meanwhile, we would like to know if a session can be arranged to discuss the solution for Project 1. This would be beneficial for us in working on Project 2. Additionally, any updates regarding the pending queries for Project 2 would be greatly appreciated. Looking forward to your response. Regards, Lakshay",

It has two parts to it. The first part is the TAs solving the Mock in real time (however this is not a solutions session). The purpose of it is to get you to realise some key things: The chaos of ROE. The adrenaline, speed of thought, the need to be very familiar with your tools. The limited time you have to use GPT effectively. It will help you with minor work flows, but not with complex tasks. (watch the session debrief to hear a clear articulation about this). The value of efficient and effective collaboration. A hodgepodge of many people will not make an effective solutions team. The ABSOLUTE importance of creating your own cheat sheet with code snippets that will help you solve ROE quickly Workflow of ROE: Data Extraction → Data Cleaning → Data Transformation → Data Analyisis → Information to answer questions The pitfalls of getting fixated on a question (a very common mistake and you can see it happen in the real time solving session as well). How limited the time is. The second part of the session was a debrief for the sheer shock that students felt. The goal of the mock was to acclimatise you to the shock of ROE. Past terms never had this benefit. We thought to take the shock factor out so that you can be better prepared than any term before. Emotions were raw. But this is normal. What is unusual is to have a preview of it before ROE. So the discussions were very intense even for us. Today’s Mock ROE will be more like a traditional solving session and deal with new aspects. It has the added bonus of being hosted on an exam server (without a time limit). I would still STRONGLY advise setting a horrible sounding alarm to acclimatise to the pressure cooker of ROE. You will make stupid mistakes under pressure. The TAs did yesterday as well. So best to reduce this factor by getting used to the clock.

    "text": "Topic: Concerns Regarding TDS Course Difficulty and Grading Fairness Post #1: Dear @jkmadathil @Anand @Bharathi First and foremost, we sincerely appreciate the efforts of the TDS team in supporting us throughout this course. The live sessions and guidance have been helpful, and we recognize the intent to make this a valuable learning experience. However, despite these efforts, many of us have faced significant challenges in keeping up with the course expectations. Key Challenges Faced Lack of Prerequisites This course did not list any prerequisites, leading many students—including those from non-technical backgrounds—to enroll with the expectation that they could keep up. However, the reality is that the course content, assignments, and projects have been far more complex than anticipated, making it difficult to manage. Project Complexity & Deadline Pressure The difficulty of the projects has been overwhelming, requiring most of us to rely heavily on peer support just to meet the deadlines. Despite putting in our best efforts, many of us struggled to complete them successfully. Course Structure Changes & Misleading Past Feedback Many students joined TDS based on past Discourse posts and feedback, which suggested a different course structure. With the recent changes, it has been a tough transition—especially for working professionals and students without prior experience. Remote Open Exam (RoE) & Graded Assignments (GAs) While we have put in significant effort—spending 2-3 days on Graded Assignments (GAs) to secure good scores—we still find ourselves struggling to meet expectations for the projects and RoE, which are significantly harder than anticipated. We completely understand the need to maintain academic standards, but we also hope fairness is considered. Since many of us are putting in our best efforts but still finding it hard to meet the course demands, we kindly request a revision of the grading pattern. Increasing the weightage of Graded Assignments (GAs) would help ensure that the dedication and hard work of students are fairly reflected in their grades. This would allow students to pass with a reasonable grade while still maintaining the integrity of the course. We truly respect the effort that has gone into designing this course, and we are all here because we genuinely want to learn and grow. We only ask that the grading structure consider the diverse backgrounds of students so that everyone has a fair chance to succeed. Thank you for your time and understanding. We appreciate your consideration and hope to find a way forward that benefits both students and the course objectives. --- Post #2: Yes sir please look into this --- Post #3: @Anand @Bharathi Yes ma’am please pay attention to our concern. --- Post #4: Yes sir, even it is tough for tech background students, just think about that how non-tech background students are handling the pressure for this course. Please consider this request. @carlton , @Saransh_Saini , @Jivraj , @Anand --- Post #5: Yes @s.anand sir @jkmadathil sir @Bharathi Mam, Plss look into this as this is becoming too too hectic ans stressful now Mam. --- Post #6: Right, I put 3 to 4 days on a GA. I still am not able to fully grasp the concept. I tried to attempt today’s mock roe, it was a disaster. I hope I can do better on next mock. I completed my project but due to some issue I failed to submit it. That’s was my mistake, and I highly regret it. I lost 20 marks because of it despite working so hard. --- Post #7: Hi @s.anand @jkmadathil @Bharathi @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini Could you please look into the above issue? Additionally, I’d like to highlight a concern regarding the current grading pattern ( JAN 2025 Term ) and overall course structuring: Grading Concerns Final Course Score: T = 0.15GAA + 0.2 ROE1 + 0.2 P1 + 0.2 P2 + 0.25 F (The weightage of Projects + ROE accounts for 60% of the total score.) From the following Discourse post, it appears that the ROE exam is extremely difficult to the point of being considered “impossible” by students: What’s the actual purpose of impossible ROE exam?. Given this, many students may directly lose 20 marks due to ROE, significantly impacting their overall scores. Furthermore, for Project 1 (deadline: 16th Feb 2025), guidance was provided only in the week of the deadline. This was highly inconvenient, as the live session did not effectively address all student concerns. As a result, many students are at risk of losing a valuable 20 marks for Project 1. Course Structuring & Scheduling Issues Many students pursuing this course are dual-degree students or working professionals, making it challenging to keep up with live sessions and deadlines. The last-minute guidance for projects adds unnecessary pressure, especially for those juggling work or other academic commitments. The structuring and scheduling of sessions feel inappropriate, with crucial guidance sessions being held too late, making it difficult to implement feedback or clarify doubts in time. Request for Improvement To ensure a smoother learning experience, I request: Early guidance and detailed instructions for Project 2, well in advance of the deadline. More structured and accessible support, considering the diverse student base, including working professionals. Better management of exam difficulty levels, ensuring that assessments are fair and reflect actual learning rather than being unnecessarily tough. I hope these concerns can be taken into account, and necessary improvements can be made. Looking forward to your response. --- Post #8: Please look into it sir. --- Post #9: Thank you @A_LAKSHMI for the detailed post. This is much appreciated. Thought of quickly stepping in before Anand or other members from the course team gives a more detailed response. Let me be Open and Blunt to all in saying that the grading pattern will not be changed. And the points below are some of quick things that came to my mind while reading the detailed listing of the challenges that have been put in the OP. TDS team have been tinkering with the course structure for the past 3 terms. You can check this Discourse thread where students have unanimously said that this is not an easy subject. In fact the first page of the TDS course GA1 itself should have given everyone an indication of what lies ahead. Anand has explicitly written down the below words: This course is quite hard Here’s students’ feedback: It used to be an easy course until 2024. # # # Now it’s hard and covers more. Take it in your last semester if possible. # # # Plan extra time. It takes more time than typical 3-credit courses. # # # LLMs grade you – unpredictably. # # The ROE is hard. # Take Graded assignment 1 to check if you’re ready for this course. Please drop this course (do it in a later term) if you score low. It’ll be too tough for you now. TDS (or for that matter any course in this Degree program) is not supposed to be a single person effort. You should be realizing this even in your real life. A significant part of our learning process is social by nature. The only difference in this course is that we we explicitly encourage you to collaborate. If there is one main life lesson that we want you to learn out of this course then it is just this - Surviving tough situations require support all around us, and there is no shame in asking for help Again to quote Anand: We encourage learning by sharing You CAN copy from friends. You can work in groups. You can share code. Even in projects, assignments, and exams (except the final end-term exam). Why should you copy? Because in real life, there’s no time to re-invent the wheel. You’ll be working in teams on the shoulders of giants. It’s important to learn how to do that well. To learn well, understand what you’re copying. If you’re short of time, prioritize. To learn better, teach what you’ve learnt. Now will be a good point to reflect on the optimization problem of Grades versus Learning. The larger question for each of you is to consider the short-term advantage of better grades versus the long term advantage of improving the fundamentals related to tools usage (not just for Data Science, but in every day life itself). Once again Anand has a nice blog where [I think] he is trying to explain that neither do we know nor do students realize what is going to ultimately benefit us. This is a journey that all of us are taking together, and we hope such open interactions along with the course will make the learning (or teaching) experience enjoyable and internally make us more humble. Whether you like it or not, life is becoming more complex day by day. And unless you figure out your optimization strategy, it is going to be a bumpy ride. And this is true even for the TDS course team members. Each of us are also juggling multiple responsibilities (some even doing 4 projects in this term) while ensuring that needed support can be provided to the learners. This is not lighten the issues that any of you have highlighted here, but just to point out that there is no flowery path for anyone here. Then the major question will be, why are all of doing this crazy business of learning tools in this way. The simplest answer is - Tools are evolving day by day, and unless we realize that they are just “tools”, it is going to consume us an eternity to master them The point of all the exercises and assessments, is for you to understand the fundamental aspects related to a tool and figure out your own strategies for getting a grip on them. @22f2001640 Management of time and difficulty levels are a shared responsibility. All of you have been sufficiently warned that the learning process wont be easy. In fact we have released all major content well in advance, so that learners can benefit from early access. And from our side, we also have realized the supporting learners wouldn’t be easy. But I see that the TDS course team members have been putting their heart and soul in this course (and support), and even in this week they have prepared 3 sets of ROEs in order to ensure that all of you get enough practice opportunity. --- Post #10: Regarding your point of the short term benefits of grades vs the long term benefits of learning, I think I’m speaking for a lot of my peers that we’re not concerned about grades at this point, we just at least want to pass this course. I’m a standalone degree potential student and while I have learned a lot from the modules and do not condone dumbing it down, but at least after all this hard work I should be able to pass the course. While grades don’t matter in front of learning things but when passing the course itself is on the line then the learnings are overshadowed by the lack of marks. I want to invest myself in the ROE and the remaining project, but at this point I’m so frustrated about getting at least 40 that rather than a valuable learning experience, this course seems like a burden to me. I understand that the grading can’t be changed. All I hope and request that project 2 and end term turn out to be more approachable than project 1 and ROE so that after all this hard work, students like me at least get the privilege to pass. --- Post #11: Nicely highlighted the concern of all students. TDS as a course has been really tedious this term. It’s a headache for those with non-technical background. IITM Management please look into this matter on urgent basis. --- Post #12: Dam… Even when I have finished the course (with a B ) I’m still getting dragged into this … --- Post #13: But still this is a huge Problem … jkmadathil: LLMs grade",

It is hard. If the marking scheme is unpredictable, why not remove the whole grading system from this course. This is punishment even when you do learn. Hopefully, I would like a better grading system in future, even the course is designed very well! --- Post #16: Seeing the difficulty of TDS I feel like appying to Anand Sir’s company lol. I am barely surviving but enjoying every moment of it. But seriously though remembering everything is super difficult. --- Post #17: You will survive.

    "text": "Topic: Clarification regarding Mock ROE Timings Post #1: Hello Sir, I understand from the email we received that there are three mock ROEs scheduled. I wanted to check if it is mandatory to attempt the mock at 7 PM or if there is flexibility in the timing. As a working professional, I may not be able to attempt the mock at 7 PM. Could you please confirm if there is any flexibility in the timings? Additionally, I would appreciate it if you could provide details on when and how the mock links will be shared. Thanks and Regards Shalini --- Post #2: Tag the TAs and instructor. Otherwise, you may not get the answer in time… --- Post #3: It is not mandatory to attempt mocks at 7pm. But we will solve it in real time during the session. Thats why we are releasing it 1 hour before. We will freeze the form submissions during the solving session and then reopen it later. ROE is not like other exams you have done so far in this entire diploma. Solving it leisurely will give you a false sense of your capabilities. The truth is everyone can get full marks for ROE given enough time. The problem is the lack of time. So if you want to really check ROE readiness, fix the timer alarm for 45 mins and attempt it genuinely within the 45 mins. Only then will you know where you stand. Additionally, each ROE is completely different from the next. If you manage to do good in one is ZERO guarantee that you will do good in the next. Thats why do all 4 mock ROEs. ROE is not like any other exam. Other exams have the same types of questions. Not with ROE. The real ROE will be also something that no one has seen before. But we will help you be as ready as possible for it. Kind regards --- Post #4: hi @carlton how are we supposed to give the mock ROE? where can I find the link? should i join gmeet while solving mock ROE or is it non-proctored? kindly clarify these doubts. thanks in advance! --- Post #5: You will get an email at 7pm with the ROE dataset and the question form. I will also add the same in the student seek portal. Mock ROEs are not proctored (its a mock!) and the actual ROE is not proctored either! The gmeet is after the mock ROE where it will be solved live by the TDS team. Kind regards --- Post #6: 3 questions:- will the questions and dataset be available after time limit? will the solutions be available for later reference with the questions? will the live solving video lecture be recorded? --- Post #7: 23f1002382: will the questions and dataset be available after time limit? They will be available after the live session has finished. 23f1002382: will the solutions be available for later reference with the questions? We will provide an answer script for Mock ROE1 23f1002382: will the live solving video lecture be recorded? Yes our live sessions will be recorded. --- Post #8: thanks for the prompt response! Cheers . Also to my understanding at sharp 7:00 we get email with form link and questions dataset? --- Post #9: Hi @carlton , I will not be able to solve the mock in the given time due to other commitments. The grading document says 2 marks bonus for mocks. Will this be a part of that? If yes, is there any other way? As you have mentioned, I will keep a timer and try to solve it in 45 minutes. --- Post #10: carlton: No, we do not provide solutions as a notebook. The ROE will be solved during the live session. yes in live session ROE was solved but while taking reference for Q1 from live session from TAs to see how this question might be solved as i was getting wrong answer, but TA also didnt solved that question in correct manner he got wrong, I think we should have at least 1 standard ref for all the questions of this mock roe to understand our mistakes in solving this questions pls understand thanks, also when i went throught live session recording i can see only 1 screen of 1 ta --- Post #11: Hi @shubhamatkal , For question1 provided answer is wrong. Regarding yesterday’s ROE we will send out ipynb with snippets of code that’s requried to solve questions.

How this is beneficial? As the GATE exam has now been completed, we can now practice the questions we either left or could not do at that time Revision will help us ace the ROE, project and end term Overall this will increase the value of the already most practical and rewarding course of IIT BS i.e TDS.

Please let me know rough submission dates if possible so that I can plan accordingly (my schedule in the upcoming days is very hectic). --- Post #2: @Yogesh GA6 will be released sometime this week. All GAs have a minimum 9 days for submissions. We do not have an ETA for Project 2 yet. Kind regards --- Post #3: @carlton If possible, could you inform what weeks the project 2 would be based on (like Project 1 was based on week 3 content). Thanks in advance. --- Post #4: Project 1 was based on Module 1 through 3. Project 2 will encompass Module 4 through 6 (and possibly 7) but not to the exclusion of the prior modules. These are not set in stone and still is in the design/validation phase. We generally avoid calling it week 3 content etc. because all the content was released as modules at the beginning well before the term was started. The GAs are released as we complete validations on them. Each term the course assignments are updated to stay current with industry expectations. So they are not recycled like subjects that are static like maths, statistics and programming which have syllabi that have not changed in 10 years or more. We try to release GAs so that they match the cadence of the other subjects for the convenience of students wherever possible. But rarely do other subjects require constant revalidation for their GAs. Hence we have situations, even in past terms, where GAs and Projects get moved to allow for robust validations of the answers. In spite of this some errors do slip through due to the aggressive time schedule in a trimester system as opposed to a semester system. Hope that give you some insight into how TDS works. Thanks for bearing with us. TDS is perpetually a WIP. Kind regards",

I request the official post to cover these. Syllabus kindly hint us on the type of questions, kind of tools to practice I did my ROE the last term, the time was not enough for me. I would like to know if it is actually possible to solve all the questions within the time Any mock or resource to practice from? additional tips, if any --- Post #2: Modules 1 - 5 Questions will be similar to GAs and the content in the modules. ROE is quite hard. Only a small number will be able to do it in the given time frame. We will have some past ROEs as practise … watch sessions Kind regards --- Post #3: Thanks for the answer @carlton Is it safe to assume that ROE is nothing but a “GA with extremely short deadline” since we don’t have proctors ? Or is the ROE more complex structured ? P.S. I am not saying the questions will be hard or easy, just asking about structure. --- Post #4: Sir questions will be of Numeeical type or MCQs type as in earlier batches it was MCQs?? --- Post #5: ROEs are always unique. They can be of any kind. We do not fix one method. Therefore its not possible to say what kind of questions will be there whether MCQ, MSQ or numerical or text etc. Kind regards --- Post #6: The ROEs are not GAs with short deadlines. A GA question usually tests one concept in isolation. ROEs typically require you to combine multiple concepts and use multiple tools in order to answer the question. (in a very short time). If your goal is totally rely on the LLM to solve it for you… past experience shows us that ROEs complexity is usually difficult for an LLM to overcome without significant assistance from the “hooomann” So practise with the concepts are going to be key without having to look up everything because looking up everything takes too much time. Collaboration with others is going be helpful. ROE is not proctored and is open internet. There is a reason for that. Its very hard. There will be a dataset or multiple datasets. Sometimes you may have to combine datasets to answer questions. You will have to extract data from the dataset. You will have to transform/clean the data and you will have to gain some information from the data, is what typical ROEs test. Kind regards --- Post #7: Is there scope for collaboration in a 45 minute test? --- Post #8: Depends on the collaborators and how they split up the tasks. If its a team that knows their roles and a team leader that can designate tasks correctly then quite possibly. In practise though that rarely happens. Also 45 mins is not a given, its a typical time we aim for. It can be shorter or longer depending on the nature of the questions in the ROE. Each one is unique. There have been ROEs as long as 2 hours and on the minimum side 30 mins.",

Would this be added to the final grade? Say for example, Someone get a full score in the first 4 assignments. So the total comes up to 39.5/39.5, and would be converted to 0.15 or 15 marks. Would the bonus mark be additional to that 15 or would the score change to 40.5/39.5 and then get normalised to 15? --- Post #22: @JoelJeffrey It will be added to the GA4 marks, not the final grade. So, it’s roughly worth 0.15% on the total - not a full 1% on the total.",

After several attempts my submission still generated differences from the supposed answers. I have tried all forms of re-punctuations but the error wont budge. I even compared the generated transcript with the actual audio several times. I BELIEVE MY ANSWER IS CORRECT. If not I wish to know what the correct answer is. Because compared to the video I have provided the exact and well punctuated transcription of the audio between 397.2 and 505.5 seconds. Here was my transcription - \" Determined to confront the mystery, Miranda followed the elusive figure. In the dim corridor, fleeting glimpses of determination and hidden sorrow emerged, challenging her assumptions of friends and foes alike. The pursuit led her to a narrow, winding passage beneath the chapel. In the oppressive darkness, the air grew cold and heavy, and every echo of her footsteps seemed to whisper warnings of secrets best left undisturbed. In a subterranean chamber, the shadow finally halted. The figure’s voice emerged from the gloom, “You are close to the truth, but be warned some secrets, once uncovered, can never be buried again.” The mysterious stranger introduced himself as Victor, a former confidant of Edmund. His words painted a tale of coercion and betrayal—a network of hidden alliances that had forced Edmond into an impossible choice. Victor detailed clandestine meetings, cryptic codes, and a secret society that manipulated fate from behind the scenes. Miranda listened, each revelation tightening the knots of suspicion around her mind. From within his warm coat, Victor produced a faded journal brimming with names, dates, and enigmatic symbols. Its contents mirrored Edmund’s diary, strengthening the case for a conspiracy rooted in treachery. The journal hinted at a hidden hall beneath the manor, where the secret society stored evidence of their manipulations. Miranda’s pulse quickened at the thought of unmasking those responsible for decades of deceit. Returning to the manor’s main hall, Miranda retraced her steps with renewed resolve. Every shadow in the corridor now seemed charged with meaning, each creak of wood a prelude to further revelations. In the manor’s basement, beneath a concealed panel, Miranda discovered another revelation \" --- Post #2: i downloaded mp3, trimmed the video using ffmpeg and used this Convert your MP3 to Text for Free Online, it worked",

Here are the highlights of the discussion: We have moved Graded Assignment 5 (GA5) deadline which was due on 16th Feb to 21st Feb next Friday. All the material to be able to do Project was available in Module 2 and Module 3, which was released on or before 10th of January (36 days ago) Project 1 was released 19th of January (27 days ago) We had over 9 hours of sessions exclusively covering Project 1 (of which at least 8 hours are available on YouTube.) This excludes any week 2 and week 3 content which also would have given you the necessary skills to do Project 1. The sessions on YouTube give you a start to finish overview of how to approach it. All of your concerns were duly noted and mentioned. Considering all the above, including the concerns mentioned by students: Project 1 deadline will NOT be changed. Please make sure to carefully read the Deliverables and the Evaluation section and do them carefully and watch the intro to Week 3 - Session 1 to get an overview of what is absolutely essential and required. Watch Week 5 both sessions to see how we construct these requirements. Kind regards TDS Team --- Post #19: -Yes sir this project 1 is very tough for even 1 question a whole day is used. @carlton @s.anand Sir besides this project we have other subject graded assignments and MLP Project and MAD2 project. Please sir it would be very beneficial for everyone, we have talked to other students also we are not able to even complete the 10 A tasks even with the evaluate.py rest aside Task B. Please sir take this into consideration. We are trying very hard for this project even you can see students asking various questions in the discourse, we are struggling but still sir we are trying. --- Post #20: @carlton @Jivraj @s.anand We truly appreciate the efforts being put by the TDS team, but not to be rude here - Why is Project 1 deadline is on Saturday and not on Sunday, as many of us are doing the course not as a full-time student. (Some have Gate exam on Saturday also). So, extending the timeline to at least Sunday, 16th Feb would be truly appreciated. Week 3 release date timeline is 24 Jan, we need adequate time to go through the weekly materials. All the contents are already released, so by the same logic upcoming Project 2 contents are also available but that doesn’t mean that we can complete the upcoming project within a week. Project help sessions came on 11th February(live) and 12th Feb on YouTube, just 4 days before the submission date, though I am not complaining about this and genuinely appreciating the team’s effort, but this does gives very less time for many of us here. Thank you. --- Post #21: sir…please extend the deadline…",

Post #1: @Jivraj @carlton sir please help When I am downloading the data folder after processing datagen.py , it is trying to download in root folder and it is facing permission error . how can we overcome this ? needs sudo permission all the time… image2100×216 100 KB --- Post #2: Hi Vikram, This is because (if you watched the session, or examined the code, you would have realised that) datagen.py was designed to run inside your docker container. And datagen.py (or a similar named file which we will not tell you ahead of time and will be provided as the query parameter in task A1) will normally be called by evaluate.py Inside the docker container, permission for the data folder is set by the Dockerfile which then allows your application to access the root folder inside your docker image and create the /data folder. So the workflow is like this (for your internal testing only… please follow the Project page for deliverables and evaluation to submit project successfully): You create your application server that serves 2 endpoints on localhost:8000 You create a docker image that runs this application server. You run the docker image using podman as described in the project page. For mimicking the testing conditions. You need two files: evaluate.py and datagen.py to be in the same folder where you are running these two scripts. Run evalute.py using uv. If your docker image is correctly configured and your application is correctly configured, then all the tasks run by evaluate.py will correctly tell you if the application is producing the right result for each task. Hope that gives clarity. Kind regards",

At least tell us , what is llm and what is use of , everything is going to above of our head . --- Post #3: Hi Hari, The goal of the course was never to go deep into specific technologies, with perhaps the exception of LLMs as major tooling capability for data science. Due to the volume of the content in the first 3 weeks it was decided to at least get students sufficient information to be able to do the Graded Assignments. One of the criticisms we received last term was that the sessions were too slow because we were covering from the very basics. So it was a conscious decision to speed up and shorten the explanations. Of course this is always difficult to get right because we respond to students in sessions. This is why attending the sessions is more valuable than watching the sessions. We cannot effectively gauge what level to pitch at if the audience is silent or not involved. We can only guess the level of the vast silent mass of students. The quality of sessions only improve when the sessions are interactive and well attended. Have you watched this session in particular? If thats insufficient for you last term we did a 2hr 48 min session on just introducing it followed by another 2 hour detailed explanation of the more advanced use cases But of course does everyone want to watch 5.5 hours of sessions to understand it? That depends on the student. Ultimately the best you can get out of sessions is by actually attending them because only then can we address gaps in understanding. Kind regards",

    "text": "Topic: Best Practices for Virtual Environments and Dependency Management in Python Post #1: Is it considered best practice to create a virtual environment rather than installing packages globally, especially when working on projects that require multiple libraries? I understand that in a professional setting, we often work on multiple projects simultaneously, and developing the habit of using virtual environments now can help reinforce this practice for future projects. Additionally, when managing dependencies, would it be better to install packages individually using pip or list them in a requirements.txt file? My understanding is that if a version is not specified in the requirements.txt file, it installs the latest available version, whereas specifying a version ensures a specific installation. However, I have encountered instances where a specific version failed to install, requiring me to modify the requirements.txt file and remove the version constraint. In such cases, wouldn’t installing directly via pip be more practical? That said, I also recognize that different projects may have unique dependency requirements. I’d appreciate your insights on best practices for managing dependencies efficiently. --- Post #2: Yes, using a virtual environment is definitely considered best practice when working on Python projects. This approach helps avoid dependency conflicts between projects and ensures a consistent development environment. The main reasons why you should use virtual environments: Isolation – Each project has its own set of dependencies, preventing conflicts with other projects. Reproducibility – A virtual environment ensures that all contributors work with the same dependencies. Portability – You can share a project with others (or deploy it) without worrying about system-wide package versions interfering. Installing with pip individually (pip install package-name) • Good for quick experimentation and testing. • Not ideal for long-term project management because dependencies might update and break compatibility over time. Using requirements.txt • Best for reproducibility and collaboration since others can install the exact same dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt. • Avoids issues where one developer uses an updated library that breaks compatibility with another developer’s setup. Specifying Versions in requirements.txt • If you don’t specify a version, pip install -r requirements.txt will install the latest available versions, which might introduce unexpected breaking changes. • If you do specify a version (package==1.2.3), you ensure consistency but may run into problems if that version becomes unavailable or has compatibility issues. Handling Version Conflicts • If a package version fails to install, try removing the strict version constraint and reinstall. • Instead of completely omitting version numbers, consider: • Using greater than/less than constraints: package>=1.2,<2.0 (allows updates but avoids major version changes). • Running pip freeze > requirements.txt after confirming a stable environment. Best Practices Summary Always use a virtual environment (e.g., venv or conda). Use a requirements.txt file for reproducibility. Pin versions cautiously—avoid unnecessary strict versioning unless needed. Periodically review and update dependencies to prevent using outdated or insecure packages. Kind regards --- Post #3: For some projects where there are many dependencies, like an ML project or flask app, it’s better you mantain a virtual environment since the dependencies are interconnected with their versions. Whereas for some simple projects, with less dependencies, global installation is fine. For project that is to be deployed, make sure you use the virtual environment, only then you can ensure what worked for you also works on the deployement 24f2006531: Additionally, when managing dependencies, would it be better to install packages individually using pip or list them in a requirements.txt file? Coming to your second question, The first time you install a fresh dependency, use direct and latest version. But if you are cloning or thinking of sharing the repo or using someone’s project it’s better to use requirements.txt. 24f2006531: My understanding is that if a version is not specified in the requirements.txt file, it installs the latest available version, whereas specifying a version ensures a specific installation The creation of requirements.txt ensures that the current installation version is listed. Never try to list requirements.txt. There is a command to do that, pip3 freeze > requirements.txt . This does the hard work of listing the dependencies for you --- Post #4: Thank you sir for clarifying. carlton: • Using greater than/less than constraints: package>=1.2,<2.0 (allows updates but avoids major version changes). I wasn’t aware of greater than/less than constraint. This would definitely address the error I mentioned in my question.",

( Mentioned that as per industrial standards/ needs). Additional programming skills are required(in addition to Python) to follow the TDS Course. That means indirectly, one should complete many courses diploma in programming before doing TDS. In such a case, how to drop the course Tools In Data Science(already registered) and get it replaced with another course to save time and without incurring financial losses(as dropping a course refunds only a certain percentage of fees amount paid for the course), and do it again later in terms. It’s completely IIT Madras’s fault since it was mentioned in the academics site that no prerequisites were required for the course while the reality turned out to be far from promises. I want to either get the course structure for the TDS revised or get it replaced with some another course; incase of some course fee difference, I will pay the difference amount. --- Post #2: i think you would have to mail this to the support --- Post #3: @Rrishit, please do share the response you receive (or maybe already have) from Support, regarding this, here.",

    "text": "Topic: Need Clarity Post #1: I feel that Week 1 is packed with tutorials from diverse areas. While I understand the necessity of these tutorials, they lack immediate exercises, which makes it difficult to retain the knowledge gained. Attempting to practice everything from these tutorials leaves insufficient time for other courses. Additionally, while solving GAs helps reinforce learning, they don’t seem to cover all the concepts from the tutorials. I would want to know whether the learning from GAs is sufficient or if there’s a better way to balance this. PS - To address this at a management level, my suggestion would be to introduce AQs or mini exercises after each module. Alternatively, we could increase questions in GAs to cover more concepts, though the first approach might be more effective. Another improvement could be to reduce the diversity of content in a single week to make it more manageable.",
